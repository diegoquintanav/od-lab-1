In support of this hypothesis, ground-foraging finches on continents (Emberizidae, Passeridae, Fringillidae), where predators are more common, have larger bodies relative to their bill sizes than do ground-foraging finches on islands (Emberizidae, Fringillidae). Ground-feeding finches on continents may also be more vulnerable to predators than tree- and shrub-foraging finches. As predicted, in North America, ground-feeding finches (Emberizinae) have larger bodies relative to their bill size than do tree- and shrub-foraging finches (Carduelinae). As a consequence of increased body size relative to bill size, both the range of possible bill sizes and potential seed sizes that can be eaten are reduced. Moreover, increased metabolic demands caused by larger body size may lessen the ability to specialize on a few seed types. These two factors reduce the potential for seed size partitioning. Consequently, vulnerability to predators may limit, and is inversely correlated with, seed size partitioning in seed-eating finch communities. The extent to which predation has influenced other bird communities may be considerable, and the patterns found by Schluter (1988a) and in this study indicate that future ecomorphological studies, especially on species that spend much of the day foraging, might profit by considering predator vulnerability as well as foraging behaviour.","inCitations":["b7b8b66f09d6f5d3336fa3533c58d9eb400918d8"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.uwyo.edu/benkman/pdfs%20of%20papers/benkman_1991.pdf"],"title":"Predation, seed size partitioning and the evolution of body size in seed-eating finches","doi":"10.1007/BF02270828","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02270828","venue":"Evolutionary Ecology"}

CF can be conceptualised as the emotional, moral and physical distress, which occurs as a consequence of caring and bearingwitness to the suffering of others. It is the cost of being a caring health professional, as a result of exposure to trauma, distress, frustrations, violence, resuscitations and death of patients in their care. EM staff impacted by CF may still be able to deliver compassion to those they work with, even though the personal toll of this care may be felt physically and emotionally with a reduced ability for self-protection. Compassion fatigue relates to the way an individual feels they are able to interact and engage with patients in a caring nature. Importantly, CF is an inherently different construct to burnout. Burnout is strongly associated with organisational environment, disillusionment, emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment and depersonalisation. CF has more features in common with vicarious or secondary trauma than burnout. A significant feature distinguishing CF from burnout is that burnout usually has a slow and gradual onset, whereas CF may be cumulative in the grief absorbed from caring for patients. Despite this insidious development, onset of CF may be felt suddenly by the individual health professional.","inCitations":["347d690d952ed18389b406bac963de5a4a6c8c35"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identifying the risk of compassion fatigue, improving compassion satisfaction and building resilience in emergency medicine.","doi":"10.1111/1742-6723.12535","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.12535","venue":"Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA"}

The purpose of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes between the 2 groups. Expression profiles were generated from 6 human ovarian surface epithelia, 8 serous borderline ovarian tumors (SBOTs), 13 LG serous ovarian carcinomas, and 24 high-grade (HG) serous ovarian carcinomas. The anterior gradient homolog 3 (AGR3) gene was found to be highly upregulated in serous borderline ovarian tumors. This finding was validated by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Anti-AGR3 immunohistochemistry was performed on an additional 56 LG and 103 HG tissues, and the results were correlated with clinical data. Expression profiling determined that 1254 genes were differentially expressed (P<0.005) among SBOT, LG, and HG tumors. SBOTs exhibited robust positive staining for AGR3, with a lower percentage of tumor cells stained in LG and HG. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that AGR3 expression was limited to ciliated cells. Tumor samples with a high percentage (>10%) of AGR3 positively stained tumor cells were associated with improved longer median survival in both the LG (P=0.013) and HG (P=0.008) serous ovarian carcinoma groups. The progression of SBOT to LG serous ovarian carcinoma may involve the dedifferentiation of ciliated cells. AGR3 could serve as a prognostic marker for survival in patients with LG and HG serous ovarian carcinomas.","inCitations":["1dd37126f74486107df7b16d81227744a0d88e50","7055983a10272d3f877cdac971dade75b530eb90","ae861e590adb53e39edf7bfc789faf4657cf4fb7","035541523125dd371c2e54bd0857bdefcc20fcd4","1c0569bdc00f5c94bca6d6ce1f0ff56ee166e186","3323a59e2d73c5d94815b319d1f5d253e5d07272","98cdd14c4a6e7caf0edcefc5261f5fece690fb82","3cf1fc5f34af504c2f7929808d5f4eecd83ce8a5","03d53f324a05fb42456153dce5030adc668b58cf","d9b5229159df105deb12abb89f9d3a4c13faedbf","74a4025efa8b72b6cb7264599635be23cd1b3064","d27c2651e9711c8c48dae29e78ed429d09d777c8","2facb4adaa52656bba0354a078744461bc20eafa","7b9bea7866a3c5eadba0eed535b1841d39ddb214","365a413840b28d8f6c3ac74d6a5145e61dc196a6","f011e402636d756b128e59db2988e9cab999647d","fa825e3dae82b525e1505482e52a8013a810915d","adfbdbc64eac001801c2965cac23123e182beb7f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The anterior gradient homolog 3 (AGR3) gene is associated with differentiation and survival in ovarian cancer.","doi":"10.1097/PAS.0b013e318212ae22","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/PAS.0b013e318212ae22","venue":"The American journal of surgical pathology"}

In the present study, the association between the XbaI polymorphism of the apo B gene was examined in patients with GBC and GS and in normal controls in a north Indian population. DNA samples from patients with GBC (n=153), GS (n=117) and healthy subjects (n=137) were analysed for the apoB-XbaI polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotype X+/− was less frequent in patients with GBC (39.2%) than in those with GS (68.3%) and in normal subjects (66.4%; P<0.00001). In contrast, there was an increase in the homozygous X−/− genotype in patients with GBC (54.9%) as compared with those with GS (23.9%) and normal subjects (25.5%; P<0.00001). The frequency of the X− allele was found to be significantly increased in GBC patients with or without GS (odds ratio=2.3 and 1.7, respectively). We suggest that the apoB-XbaI gene polymorphism confers susceptibility to carcinoma of the gallbladder under specific environmental conditions.","inCitations":["577ddf7b615ec04b7b4d566c4bb81b43d634686b","5091b9994cc69854f2319db1918bad5cb8fe6b4a","8d96924fc16374da06ee6a6ee69ad83bd7530c28","5185e3a1bd1735c9fba09f9d1c382c1a7e683d11"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Apolipoprotein B-100 XbaI gene polymorphism in gallbladder cancer","doi":"10.1007/s00439-003-1056-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-003-1056-8","venue":"Human Genetics"}

The shifts in the respiratory modulation of heart rate, or respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), reflect the different levels of practice among practitioners with variable experience in Zazen; in turn the modulation of the RSA may reflect changes in the breathing pattern as in the parasympathetic outflow related to the quality and focus of attention in each stage.","inCitations":["35288e6b69c18e92b018bcc1e159e79947a72fd2","9418190c005ba8fc83ec7ac96044f0e7f59f5f23","382d5d1b83e3d970e383dc677b5075013c249fcb","859251d382cbd54b2fc64651a2d25ab1dd7b65e6","e6599b5269bead17a53d0e4a204abeb1773558e2","927da7ecc962b3d6a93c71194081f22952453022","96e8cb13b4c2da44858a10f58a17e10b2f4a401a","6715e868a0da1b4298e91d415d4da6d497f70d14","4a7a3732543c8e2173f90d5cb8b6c5e77a062562","3571c805e16a8a30334a9959cc7652ebf8d915bc","a6ba3337af9d66f545295869f82e29c4bc979f30","b58adde2f63b3c2e1b43dd81692f691c4a9769de","cc341286d0dc1461b6a623b589e5c32032ad3153","bb0da33925ce98f7baae63661432541b87267f72","3fdcf71b5220dd32fe2f9cbfc5208a407ee4a9e0","53eb00b42693d5b7b347243a6ed3d83c7a5a83b7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Heart rate dynamics in different levels of Zen meditation.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.06.058","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.06.058","venue":"International journal of cardiology"}

We offer an advanced elective course that combines an online learning module and high-fidelity human patient simulation (HPS) technology. This course has been previously described in more detail. Instructors use an adult learning approach having pharmacy students review Internetbased learning modules before class to understand current evidence-based drug treatments. Students are then engaged in real-life scenarios using HPS. A major goal of this course is to develop students’ critical thinking skills. During HPS cases, students receive a synopsis of the patient’s condition and are expected to use critical thinking to evaluate what additional information they need to develop a pharmacotherapy plan. Previously, facilitators used a couple of options to communicate the information requested by students including a simulated paper chart or verbal communication. The simulated paper chart has limitations: (1) All information is given to the students, and this may not necessarily require critically thinking about obtaining pertinent data. (2) The facilitator cannot easily evaluate the students’ thinking process supporting their treatment recommendations. The other approach for transferring relevant information to students involves facilitators providing requested information verbally. Although this allows facilitators to evaluate the students’ critical thinking process, it is time consuming for students to manually copy all information stated aloud, thus limiting the time available for active learning 1-hour HPS cases. Bump Technologies, Inc (Mountain View, CA) application for mobile devices was used to transfer requested information to students in a form that simulates using an electronic patient chart during the in-class cases. Each file was easily transferred to the student requesting the information by bumping or tapping the facilitator’s and the student’s electronic devices together. Facilitators designed the patient chart in separate JPEG files containing pertinent information (eg, medical history, allergies, laboratory results, chest radiograph). An example of a screenshot for laboratory values, culture results, and a chest radiograph that the student received is displayed in Figure 1. Visualization of the information is limited to the student requesting the Bump. Students used their own electronic devices, so a variety of devices were used. This application was chosen because it is easy to use, available to students for use with several brands of mobile smart devices or tablet devices, and free to download. Applying Bump technology further enhanced an active learning environment for students. Facilitators noticed that using Bump increased the opportunity for students to think critically in a stepwise fashion as students requested each piece of patient data, thus contributing to their learning. Challenges that arose included occasional Internet service interruption that prevented bumping and font size appearing small on large text files, making visibility on some handhelds difficult. We noticed that limiting the amount of text provided in each file corrected the problem. Students using tablet computers did not have visibility problems. Overall, use of Bump allowed students to (1) apply critical thinking processes that were obvious to the facilitator and (2) have more time for learning compared with other methods of transferring information.","inCitations":["b14ff21a349e8395178e1f009ad5e1cf41072d2b","9c6148eb945b00f1f5aee26c034815908e5051d1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"\"Bump\":  using a mobile app to enhance learning in simulation scenarios.","doi":"10.1097/SIH.0b013e31825e8bcf","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/SIH.0b013e31825e8bcf","venue":"Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare"}

Given a set of observations originating from a K -component mixture, we focus on the estimation of the component expectations. We propose an algorithm based on the minimization of the “K -product” (KP) criterion we introduced in a previous work. We show that the global minimum of this criterion can be reached by first solving a linear system then calculating the roots of some polynomial of order K . The KP global minimum provides a first raw estimate of the component expectations, then a nearest-neighbour classification enables to refine this estimation. Our method’s relevance is finally illustrated through simulations of various mixtures. When the mixture components do not strongly overlap, the KP algorithm provides better estimates than the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.","inCitations":["4c63209373df2242a5f4d6182803180633622dad","1ada11628565e0be9096ae0bcf4a5880dab6bf06","f58c7527bc0ece490f2677afbe0123be732119e1","8b31484de223abab4096942645ecdb34bb799a77"],"pdfUrls":["http://cedric.cnam.fr/fichiers/art_2242.pdf","http://163.173.228.40/fichiers/art_2242.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11634-007-0014-z"],"title":"A global algorithm to estimate the expectations of the components of an observed univariate mixture","doi":"10.1007/s11634-007-0014-z","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11634-007-0014-z","venue":"Adv.

Early feeding contributes to formation of food habits, and food preferences track from infancy to adulthood. Taste preferences play a key role in formation of food habits and can be influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Flavor, experienced by taste, smell, and hemosensory irritation, has been demonstrated in human fetal life. Food flavors transmitted from the mother’s diet through amniotic fluid can influence food acceptance. Newborns and infants also respond to flavors during milk feeding. Human milk contains volatile food odors and varies depending on maternal food intake. In contrast, formula milk has a uniform flavor. Some studies have shown the acceptance of basic taste in weaning is different among breastfeeding and formula-feeding infants. However, it is not known if these taste preferences are present before weaning, especially around 3–4 months of age, the period of optimal acceptance for new taste described as a developmental window. The aim of our study was to compare preferences to basic taste among breastfed and formula-fed infants. This cross-sectional study was developed at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira Hospital (Recife, PE, Brazil) between August 2011 to March 2012. This study was previously approved by the Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira Ethical Committee in Research, and written informed consent was obtained. Sixty-three healthy infants 3 months of age, all born fullterm, were studied. Exclusively breastfeeding infants were according to the World Health Organization definition. Other infants were habitually fed only on cow’s milk formula (NAN I; Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland). Infants with diseases that could impair growth were excluded. Each child was tested at the same time of day (9:00 a.m.) accompanied by his or her mother in an isolated room (at a temperature of 23 C). All children received their previous meal an hour before the test. The stimulus was given in the following sequence with an interval of 1 minute: glucose (0.3 M), sodium chloride (0.3 M), sodium citrate (0.001 M), and urea (0.18 M). A 1-mL disposable syringe was used to apply 0.2 mL of solution on the dorsal surface of the tongue. All infants were held upright facing forward during the test and had their face videotaped during a 1-minute interval. The facial responses were coded into nine action units according to the Baby Facial Action Coding System: A1 represents no distinct mouth action or sucking on the face; A2 is A1 with a negative expression on the mid-face; A3 is A1 with a negative expression on the mid-face and brows; B1 represents the facial response of a pursing mouth; B2 is B1 with a negative expression on the mid-face; B3 is B1 with a negative expression on the mid-face and brows; C1 represents a mouth-gaping action; C2 is C1 with a negative expression on the mid-face; and C3 is C1 with a negative expression on the mid-face and brows. Two trained professionals who were unaware of the study aims watched the videotape recordings to classify facial responses. Reliability for scoring was 88% ( p < 0.001). The data were analyzed by SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The frequency of the facial action units was compared between breastfeeding and formula-feeding infants. The v test was used, and significance was considered at p< 0.005. We studied 60 infants, 27 exclusively breastfeeding and 33 formula feeding. Both groups did not differ in age, gender, birth weight, and delivery: the average age was 3.3 months (SD, 0.2 months); 46.6% were male; birth weight ranged from 2,980 g to 4,010 g (average, 3,241– 332 g); and 40% were born by cesarean section. Facial responses to taste solutions showed differences; more liking responses were shown to sweet (88.3%), followed by salty (51.7%), sour (30.0%), and bitter (28.3%) tastes. Facial responses to basic tastes showed no difference among breastfed and formula-fed infants in our study (Table 1). Despite the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for health, both in the period of breastfeeding and in later stages of life, there are few studies that had assessed taste responses in early infancy. Formula-fed infants are exposed to a constant flavor, a predominantly sweet taste, whereas breastfed infants can be exposed to different flavors, also a predominantly sweet taste, depending on the maternal diet. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to assess preferences to basic tastes comparing breastfeeding and formula-feeding infants at 3 months of age. Most of the studies have been done during weaning, and some differences in food acceptance were found among breastfed and formula-fed infants.","inCitations":["42c90373ed06611616a2997537add6fafa1a6c4e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Facial responses to basic tastes in breastfeeding and formula-feeding infants.","doi":"10.1089/bfm.2012.0092","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/bfm.2012.0092","venue":"Breastfeeding medicine : the official journal of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine"}

This study explores the extent to which violence on the street can be explained by rational factors associated with the successful commission of the offence or social factors related to street culture. The study is based on qualitative interviews with 55 violent street offenders who were serving sentences for street robbery and assault in six prisons in the United Kingdom. The findings, based on accounts of 101 incidents of street violence, identified four main explanations for street violence: (a) successful offence enactment, (b) buzz and excitement, (c) status and honor, and (d) informal justice. The article concludes that there might be benefits in combining the insights of both perspectives by generating an integrated theory that would properly explain both the rational and the seemingly irrational components of street violence.","inCitations":["066b1bd42bff50e5e47f7a9e365159cdc8854823","027cbf1dd10ae53993e5d6f9a693bead55bf6bd4","808a589ba70af3a7d7e456561fd4cba970aff628","1012a26f49456265dd614fb237e59f68463425b6"],"pdfUrls":["https://studysites.sagepub.com/walshstudy/articles/section3/Bennett.pdf","https://www.safetylit.org/citations/ild_request_form.php?article_id=citjournalarticle_89894_20"],"title":"The role of violence in street crime: a qualitative study of violent offenders.","doi":"10.1177/0306624X08323158","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0306624X08323158","venue":"International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology"}

In an instance of this problem, we are given an undirected graph G = (V,E), a set of terminals R ⊆ V , and non-negative costs ce for all edges e ∈ E . Any tree that contains all terminals is called a Steiner tree; the goal is to find a minimum-cost Steiner tree. The nodes V\\R are called Steiner nodes. The best approximation algorithm known for the Steiner tree problem is due to Robins and Zelikovsky (SIAM J. Discrete Math, 2005); their greedy algorithm achieves a performance guarantee of 1 + ln3 2 ≈ 1.55. The best known linear programming (LP)-based algorithm, on the other hand, is due to Goemans and Bertsimas (Math. Programming, 1993) and achieves an approximation ratio of 2−2/|R|. In this paper we establish a link between greedy and LP-based approaches by showing that Robins and Zelikovsky’s algorithm has a natural primal-dual interpretation with respect to a novel partition-based linear programming relaxation. We also exhibit surprising connections between the new formulation and existing LPs and we show that the new LP is stronger than the bidirected cut formulation. An instance is b-quasi-bipartite if each connected component of G\\R has at most b vertices. We show that Robins’ and Zelikovsky’s algorithm has an approximation ratio better than 1 + ln3 2 for such instances, and we prove that the integrality gap of our LP is between 7 and 2b+1 b+1 .","inCitations":["a494d3d168d1324bd6b59077dfd74b5c8a66909a","ef4d60e16e2090ab49516ddddc22b406337d1ba0","4163772b9170305db6d84ebc9a27a2787cf16930","6cc8ae3f8247b9ec0764c93c98517128ff399a41","445ee1be3b15731361ae3ae25bb7ef7b24cc9921","6675cb70158577eb78e724f6e08e887b7ae39da8","7e974e8eed5a121143e0e5a670c304b12a2d1f79","a0160e2e5772fa77878392d158eb6d6d2f81c95b","c4f0cdc5269051ec86ba59acf2b6583e2acc3670","4b6d1274b22216b8c6d7b327f25963e2af0d08e0","8c92395df1c7da0346d52683c96560f3043a2d69","3e01070665bda1cfbe1f6c9089bed8a362e99797","118d7bb03a506abac1f790dec707ad9897da9178","157edd2e972af6fa73632cd932ade29ee711a3f1"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-009-0289-2","http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~jochen/docs/zel-jour.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3568v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3568v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3568"],"title":"A Partition-Based Relaxation For Steiner Trees","doi":"10.1007/s10107-009-0289-2","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-009-0289-2","venue":"Math.

Most previous 3-D modeling methods which directly recover 3-D geometry from single images require user interactions during the whole modeling process. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic 3-D modeling approach to recover accurate 3-D geometry from a single image of a piecewise planar object with less user interaction. Our approach concentrates on these three aspects: (1) requiring rough sketch input only, (2) accurate modeling for a large class of objects, and (3) automatically recovering the invisible part of an object and providing a complete 3-D model. Experimental results on various objects show that the proposed approach provides a good solution to these three problems. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Multiple biometrics are fused at the decision level to support a system that can meet more challenging and varying accuracy requirements as well as address user needs such as ease of use and universality better than a single biometric system or static multimodal biometric system. The decision fusion rules are adapted to meet the varying system needs by particle swarm optimization, which is an evolutionary algorithm. This paper focuses on the details of this new sensor management algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness. The evolutionary nature of adaptive, multimodal biometric management (AMBM) allows it to react in pseudoreal time to changing security needs as well as user needs. Error weights are modified to reflect the security and user needs of the system. The AMBM algorithm selects the fusion rule and sensor operating points to optimize system performance in terms of accuracy.","inCitations":["e459cbc47c0731490d58e7d530961f1b8774a347","66bd5d20e2c05c35142efc9ca2ebf08cd826c179","a0b2c93c1e805fdbbee5409fdf28e2c5065ab29a","59bb6d9214dc5ce525ff5f67e3f8088b11d2bdc8","26940cb452c78ad4dd2b26ce8a89f4896017f1f4","36f51e7c254c5bde170296ceb5fc3af6ce7774bc","161713a23aea00290f716a99659264f49e0373d5","87903d466a41b165cde4ada5e72c4697f9fe2da7","bbad99ab986682c46d551078b58538099df4bf80","0c4d466e587916cdc52816f7f4c41e1838895aa0","6b29f649186a1387c53236fc2d60a860c7f567da","616dabec42d16fac59aaceec6d05a19a9f09e061","df6d929d09bda0053371021e174e76f037c6cc79","e3a31fe9e2bc99c659f04e351b07d0d03124c110","a73308d440625a67c80cd2d5c9090008c9be9f80","61279cc2520b3edc44e84a7b05dc255ec3332e7e","d9569b7b42b799e4c945b556eed79936ba065872","bba9bcefb3d23f9dd80186c1e0fa47c58b3bc92e","0c77e5859ca5d5efc955ca6db77c98cbbd04f356","7b9961094d3e664fc76b12211f06e12c47a7e77d","f78cc9c8759d1d778d757e7ec0a9649c5ca855d5","b770a5b04ade847a280ff626a2afa35489db8828","2034e43fde786f10a89b8c9590f9c8607797aa35","1e2ff69eec301d90a4f15fc1d3fd0cf380523805","4090679fdab7b2890efc40cfb572c4d2ecc193b8","ab7368eab7dd9b6c3a05915df3c7cd269d651ec1","2f067b9a7f9075029eaf6cef5602e1c8540df768","a21d81141c98943432da0e3fbd42ab3c59dedc71","5620a743c44597c6b187dccf8c562fdcbd2f7d52","356bf0d1c54870aaa4f34c97f3705e6ff410268f","195a0b99746a558a355ae5170a61545ef1900e17","6adcecae45a2306a3996aba27c65ecea7d687d18","e2b68bf0f8f5854430cc47b4676b1fa3cc928d20","ac21079c6073075d9dbdd22be6781b5cab054461","6b6866fbb4354e30ab34db9d6a8a07da4bf25777","30ee519c058d03652a7c0a683abe0469b29e4908","419ed657e0d618cf08b36ff2bd053b6ef20aba29","14d05578d0b6b71c2f023b71e9fe71a6b44430da","b487a2d53aa23de0793a7573ccabd6294c6c6884","9edc5a7f1af03bb421cf03e2ad33e48f4880d7f1","1f10e419aebfe6768f14a13bd3af65e84a58da00","2740448e6c206a2eca125b1b61072919b2e5afe8","19b5ea7d9425178027d328dd14fc8f36cbb59116","ad1470bd0eace2d3df7390c4c42ac56e9640a2fc","c3ba89c44e44d72be8b7505cbf3ce6ac2e7e0433","826d392ee713cd48a837f3a9e825b29c51101049","452a8def123e53288b52a3b233baf1e9aba6f943","920d787a2c91b3c050d2b92d8e2a075faac3f4bf","77a734f3456da3516c73e21e0f38e35da22f62bc","668e93e89835ec662d21cf695b7347339ce74c78","1dc2cc88e46f79cd7466c32b262bd8dde2247e10","8d8ac727d6990a6ccad0e69e491ed4fe7931127b","b24712b6f74092c2319f8847595c67b314ffb6aa","b73db6cadd7a9b4c1d957112de7b173881e9d87d","016833d25a65c49765e43abfda7deef0179729ec","f72295465ed26a869865c638446e04a03ef7b20a","fdc91ce300e0d04916e70e4f33e9b31c6b7bcb91","ca73351816ff6dbedb53ab070221bafea5f155f7","06e29b4ddc9b76e168736167ff7d4cc7c0edf5da","67856e4278e4e861ba219ec887cc51f6de5c4b03","0819683f950db1d3351f74f03e4da51e3da1d633","98dc085949c9a98a50f55823e1ef585657404473","3abd15399a2ed54bd8e62a7708b34404e6717eeb","d624d2a7e61b9cffecb6fc7b7e558c262deedcf2","71c22ebae671104f04faa5a6084e9745b4b04ade","d3ac8970fadcd7bd9429c57060211ed4b9e52d87","116b67cf2ad2c948533e6890a9fccc5543dded89","49cadfe638e17ad9b8ff40ef521863f7e5b5cd25","ede266cfcb3dca71983ba72ea6c774d1be4e6ac4","1d56d3b129e2671d42f656114a628e31fb181965","1280cfae123ba34e0e4b419fe2817ad5b6aae4de","b22a8277be5543a06314263dab2d5c85140c7af3"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ecs.syr.edu/research/dreamsnet/people/ambm.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2005.848191"],"title":"An adaptive multimodal biometric management algorithm","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2005.848191","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2005.848191","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)"}

Methods: One hundred nineteen correctional officers (109 males and 10 females) employed in Turkey participated in this study. In addition to WSSCO, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) were administered to the participants. Results: The internal consistencies and the item-total correlations were acceptable both for the whole scale and for its subscales; namely, “work overload,” “role conflict and role ambiguity,” “inadequacies in physical conditions of prison,” “threat perception,” and “general problems.” Test–retest reliability coefficient was 0.77 for total scale, and test-retest reliability coefficients ranged between 0.68 and 0.78 for the subscales. The total scale and most of the subscales were positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and hopelessness, and negatively correlated with perceived social support. Furthermore, all subscales significantly differentiated high depressive symptomatology group from the low depressive symptomatology group. Conclusions: The present results revealed that the psychometric properties of WSSCO were quite adequate. The scale can provide a potentially useful tool for research on job stress in correctional officers.","inCitations":["81fa8df3fc99f7a10736da55df076c4272f1de69","7cce7c1a0e3e052d70f4da7d185673516634636d","49b2e18d2048dd0438a1e016951dc16f9c5b4bbe","a692e77d5db473bfe729a9cb2a62eff0ab17666b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Development of Work Stress Scale for Correctional Officers","doi":"10.1007/s10926-005-9006-z","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-005-9006-z","venue":"Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation"}

Precise digital soil maps can help to till agricultural fields with more accuracy, greater cost-efficiency and better environmental protection. In the present study, the laboratory analysis of sand, silt, clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) content was combined with hyperspectral image data to estimate the distribution of soil texture and SOC across an agricultural area. The aim was to identify regions with similar soil properties and derive uniform soil regions based on this information. Soil parameter data and corresponding laboratory spectra were used to calibrate cross-validated (leave-one-out) partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, resulting in robust models for sand (R2 = 0.77, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 5.37) and SOC (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.27), as well as moderate models for silt (R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 5.46) and clay (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 2.39). The regression models were applied to Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications DUAL (aisaDUAL) hyperspectral image data to spatially estimate the concentration of these parameters. Afterwards, a decision tree, based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) soil texture classification scheme, was developed to determine the soil texture for each pixel of the hyperspectral airborne data. These soil texture regions were further refined with the spatial SOC estimations. The developed method is useful to identify spatial regions with similar soil properties, which can provide a vital information source for an adapted treatment of agricultural fields in terms of the necessary amount of fertilizers or water. The approach can also be adapted to wider regions with a larger sample size to create detailed digital soil maps (DSMs). Further, the presented method should be applied to future hyperspectral satellite missions like Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMap) and Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) to cover larger areas in shorter time intervals. Updated DSMs on a regular basis could particularly support precision farming aspects.","inCitations":["c0535143f3ec2d0919791bfba8348f68c34c1002","fdc91fd28466c99667d4559fd1abf673a4d8a62b","db52dc2231a856b8d3653c9af6413f74b0f71412"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8110927","https://repositorium.uni-osnabrueck.de/bitstream/urn:nbn:de:gbv:700-2017032715771/3/Zeitschriftenartikel_Remote_Sens_8_11_2016_Kanning.pdf"],"title":"Regionalization of Uncovered Agricultural Soils Based on Organic Carbon and Soil Texture Estimations","doi":"10.3390/rs8110927","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8110927","venue":"Remote Sensing"}

After only descriptive test information, the most popular strategies were FOBT alone (45%) or both tests (38%). Fewer patients preferred FSIG alone (13%). After information about test performance, more subjects preferred both tests (47%), and fewer subjects preferred FOBT alone (36%) (p=.12). With hypothetical out-of-pocket costs, the proportion preferring FOBT alone increased to 53%, while those preferring both tests decreased to 31% (p<.001). Less than 5% of patients preferred no screening. CONCLUSIONS: Patient preferences for colon cancer screening were modestly sensitive to information about test performance and strongly sensitive to out-of-pocket costs. The heterogeneity of patients’ preferences for how to be screened supports informed shared decision making as a possible means of improving colon cancer screening.","inCitations":["360dfb69ec6357abc18b7266f1b18014bb2368f3","f84775a3d070cc1c71357d5ef234cacb59239346","3aa597ee24f4da778b89a1b14808bef7ecf1d6c9","4d6c53c53925500d53ab390f9331a8418992b33b","c19c39d29d6fbb2656c0b9e2972554567669a9ae","cefd53c5f9f6fe61f097d05899ce1122bc2b754a","bbf2d75a5d1a753bdba339c7c52e11fdac8b8f4a","22b6cfb06de6c4d4350edf44aad883e8c178c6d2","81e9f803121a04da34c8e52fd41ea26c2c3bd5db","a7719692c7c5c7968a13de45f0c0699e3735cda2","8e242fb3431331207b0a97c195853ae1c8ba4754","e1c31547c995df75d0111f17e3bbba8a078ed331","2e26af5c5a03aba556a3f0181171afb63e612d09","17bf4c317ea4e9105c70475075f108ca31ac6845","5e863bd0885037006fe49d66ad48299a0557cc6b","49f22ed29ea5f3712f34a570621f101a86b3fb57","1ae3c7e947cfbe55f89377c290aff6a3616eacec","d5dcc103726819f8afbe288e3a9a7d0433f9b930","694b4fefbdf182a9d835df8611b43da91d260c97","56f40c3a03437a609bd2536ceba25b393f1c850a","2da1c7e5b6f94993677da7bcf41f6abe620c9b84","9197521e4e38782bd229091442f87914fa707110","7e4111b4f9d49dcace69164f07a1211f8563e688","2b92ffd4f24fcb8503ec9e530bbf181306cc183f","5b75b76a3c605648495ca5dd4a21c929f35b67b2","6085df621c17d470e1ca76c280a9e39dc6448bb2","12f3d0f3273bea84f497bb3d0db0661537e0dbf8","3ded4cd5d14b28f48850f61d88a5a3d7a7d9d894","488d9285d7e45163a52de315b5a29e015bbfc723","9bd0e55019b0377048062041d28fbb3aa962845e","49407eef3aee54c62fa7d2def85132ab7bcdbf12","504fe8c8a0067d41c5379758490553d116c560e1","6651b6dda08908aa47eb69983822fd2201059da2","434396c9180dad21bbd1401078017e79f9b80926","b9ae63971d70c5250d50fcb190660058fa74304b","35d8f4551fc0e25b30b4639cc2560aac88835b35","8f0411bd441ddc254dabe324aa13ac447716610a","7619508945d5f90492bdd2cf9d71811ae1988b21","d51fadd7df74f1c0530c86482f45d80f35bf44e4","7371fb4121b662537e161c4a825ca8e34a67f425","f326e4417dab52d57e49e37ea1df5eff1403a8fd","494e07745cc0b24e76d5b89090e5f0cd336f8f16","8fe702164c386636f8b93b07a86a2c509bf6fb78","7a9e96223cd248ff7a9a619f3843e515d59c5f34","ff5146e8ef1690153648007427c2b9f504006f2d","197e9e1fedfdfaa18a0a9572365126d759e4428b","91b8c43c4401c858a71616676645cd4385a7e4f1","ede8a22cfa1102afd3f28e8a5ea9c04e58938a1c","159eab869d8de9e05ee256a9ab802bf87f704d79","584619d9a9d95d9edf470e06a423a857715d342a","24fef6743868458f6592f2079eb719a1eb43b547","394a231c53896708f0ee60209c2d19034d4b5e92","e8c71c4df419ba8f04a6a4d2042f8d383b2b8089","207d4bbce48063e5b637354a1b374dcbc152cf72"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Patient preferences for colon cancer screening","doi":"10.1046/j.1525-1497.1999.00018.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1525-1497.1999.00018.x","venue":"Journal of General Internal Medicine"}

At the time of inquiry they were between 35 and 51 years of age, and at the end of follow-up between 46 and 63. There was an overall weak negative association between daily intake of coffee and risk of breast cancer, which was not statistically significant. However, the association with coffee varied, depending on the body mass index (BMI) of the women. In the lean (Quetelet less than 24; population mean) there was an inverse relation between coffee intake and risk of breast cancer (chi 2 trend = 5.07, P = 0.02). In this group, women who reported drinking 5 cups or more per day had an age-adjusted IRR of 0.5 (95% confidence intervals, 0.3 and 0.9) compared to women who had 2 cups or less. In women with Quetelet's index equal to or greater than 24 there was a positive relation between coffee intake and breast cancer risk (chi 2 trend = 2.33, P = 0.13), where the corresponding age-adjusted IRR was 2.1 (95% confidence intervals, 0.8 and 5.2). This interaction effect between coffee intake and BMI was statistically significant (chi 2 interaction = 10.2, 3 d.f., P = 0.02). In summary, the results of this study suggest that coffee consumption reduces the risk of breast cancer in lean women, whereas coffee might have the opposite effect in relatively obese women.","inCitations":["ef540f174ef0bc4f01514d8eabcf348a0e648676","fa7be02b4db47e38deaf3b0a474269e392dc1d58","ae8fb49d35a34abde91f7296636703c26b3a8374","eb6bebbcc082a13840caa12d416c5e6cd12ea370","080b17ff02df6ac7bf270a06abe1cfbba4e2a9ff","57a2cf34736e68bb101f2ea65fe959ebcc481170","0ae42471bfefad79d9df4a986a20a6c54e2c5d19","e230fa896c3eff81506d53954c357f46399586df","9f0f52cf0bdf5feade381ed322b06ef77c74a127","e18bd39258421019390e7d9330105891eca98c27","549ea0196b4c63e497550958d7afc181ffc8ed93","15ff05f72c76a49ff3c31c98bfdf2d76f64098ec","9f6f319779924dcc859310f282f14b8207d5c7c8","7a14f0ec8037e3390e4cb017fa1aa2a81f3bc972","96582162d0787d3f82b37e51919aaac2ee74fffb","ca7da2ff42c1158032e50b2757c2a670d7159a2f","0e843de93df65f22e0244cefcac56584f12c4842","d860449b3fd8a265ddc66c1a9b72fb4e995cea6d","20ac41cd3cfc311c3a4c391941be0dce7e0537cd","689185adb29afbccb056f84701bf9f830b35a060","31b634027d41bafd1820ea65388f81bef3f77c4f"],"pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/2e/73/Br_J_Cancer_1990_Aug_62(2)_267-270.tar.gz","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/2e/73/brjcancer00216-0097.PMC1971813.pdf"],"title":"Coffee consumption and the risk of breast cancer.

For economic and medical purposes valid instruments are required to assess disease processes and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for different forms and stages of illness. In principal, the impact of illness and success of an intervention can be assessed with biomedical variables, e.g. severity of symptoms or frequency of complications of a disease. However, this does not allow clear judgement on clinical relevance or comparison across different diseases.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nOutcome model variables such as quality of life (QoL) or health care resource utilization require the patient to appraise their own well-being or third parties to set preferences. In Alzheimer's disease and other dementias the evaluation process performed by the patient is subject to the disease process itself because over progress of the disease neuroanatomical structures are affected that mediate evaluation processes.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nPublished research and methodological considerations thus lead to the conclusion that current QoL-instruments, which have been useful in other contexts, are ill-suited and insufficiently validated to play a major role in dementia research, decision making and resource allocation. New models integrating biomedical and outcome variables need to be developed in order to meet the upcoming medical and economic challenges.","inCitations":["0314409fdf7eb804855b5bc27280b1e2482b0f27","3ebbbc95132681ea299bbdfeb4fdde6dd32fa824","39f37d4e0fceac22abb79066b8710891422dc264","3aa04de3ab406c0d1220472360622fe76b4ab98e","9932d9be42b9e2896115032177b7212753dbdeda","bb2a0014e36f2ef808f83aa0830399c547afc020","d6768c64f00c52e3b281ca0f7b648bf54a5962ea","2f0b7005f63825e3be132af6dd733d6125065af0"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/54/6a/1471-2377-9-47.PMC2746172.pdf","https://www.biomedcentral.com/imedia/1246025704266081_manuscript.pdf"],"title":"Quality of Life as an outcome in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias- obstacles and goals","doi":"10.1186/1471-2377-9-47","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2377-9-47","venue":"BMC neurology"}

Three standardized self-reporting questionnaires were applied, which are the Freiburg Questionnaire of Coping with Illness (FKV), the von Zerssen Depression Scale (D-S), and the IPC-questionnaire measuring generalized locus of control beliefs; the Social Interview Schedule (SIS), a semi-structured interview, was used to measure the psychosocial adaptation. Active, problem-focused and compliance strategies were predominantly used and regarded as most helpful. Hence, the epileptic patients use similar coping patterns reported in patients with other non life-threatening chronic diseases. The level of depression was moderate and in the range of other chronic somatic diseases. The use of coping patterns, which are regarded as maladaptive, was correlated with distinct depression, a small degree of internal locus of control beliefs and poor psychosocial adaption. These results indicate the possibility to improve psychosocial adjustment by supporting effective strategies.","inCitations":["7c0ea40daba5d6f200612bcca2ed31b3cf7ea545","6f3b9b94994b2a756c354850483797c1544a3537","3f13b2dea5cf2b95d9b09b247e24716eebe3edcf","0afedb0561e8356751f4cee1865b7b4c0e8316fb","90da321801571bd42bba01167d6ec627495bbf7a","c4a8a717c3f32247350fc3f423017a16241768ca","808cfd3b8dcf9f1e113eb9622ab2daa338914f7c"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1059131198902400","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059131198902400"],"title":"Coping with refractory epilepsy","doi":"10.1053/seiz.1998.0240","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1053/seiz.1998.0240","venue":"Seizure"}

However, the effectiveness of KM on labor productivity is not known exactly, especially since it depends on the development level of a country. To find a solution based on KM approach for improving the labor productivity of Vietnamese enterprise, a new model is proposed, which includes knowledge capability, technology capability, KM, employee satisfaction, and labor productivity. By analyzing data from Vietnamese enterprises, the model is tested and suggestions for improving the labor productivity of Vietnamese enterprises are made. Some results of data analysis are: employee satisfaction positively affects the labor productivity and that KM has a strong effect on employee satisfaction. Further, some suggestions for improving the labor productivity of Vietnamese enterprises are: organizing frequent meetings for shortening cultural gap between managers and employees, replacing old machines combined with improving employees’ self learning skill, improving innovation capability by creating an open culture for encouraging employees to voice their opinions.

Appl. of AI","paperAbstract":"This paper presents a system implemented to evaluate the retrieval efficiency of images when they are semantically indexed using a combination of a web ontology language and the low-level features of the image. Finding a similarity measure algorithm to retrieve images based on the semantic metadata can be very challenging due to diverse image content and inadequate domain-specific ontologies describing the content. The existing methods for indexing images are primarily based on text. While these methods are widely used due to their simplicity, they are not very efficient as they require a domain expert and the textual interpretations of image content vary from person to person. In our approach, we leverage sophisticated image-processing techniques to automatically extract image content information into MPEG-7 format and associate them to the existing domain ontologies developed by experts, thereby, bridging the gap between low-level features and high-level semantics. This implementation and validation experiments show that a high retrieval accuracy rate is obtained when all the image descriptors are combined with an ontology while building the semantic metadata for indexing images. & 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested this hypothesis in anti-Fas-treated apoptotic Jurkat cells. Several nuclear proteins known for their association with both MARs and the nuclear matrix, that is, PARP, NuMA, lamin B and SATB1, were degraded, but the morphological rearrangement of the BUR-binding SATB1 protein was one of the earliest detected changes. Subsequently, we have identified several genes containing sequences homologous to the 25 bp BUR element of the IgH gene, a known SATB1-binding site, and examined the integrity of genomic DNA in their vicinity. Multiple ss breaks were found in close proximity to these sites relative to adjacent regions of DNA. Consistent with our prediction, the results indicated that the initiation of DNA cleavage in anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells occurred within the BUR sites, which likely became accessible to endonucleases due to the degradation of BUR-binding proteins.","inCitations":["1eb87fc508139712033eb16363744219602e172d","50d98c51f2ba28b937f6564d3d78015a143a4a69","761911c77f201325335dca468e4e452644ff152c","cbe952a8ab25a6e8d89c47d222199704d263a2a3","1e37aad56611765b38f4a0df36d5ed22a0ac961b","028869dfb9e2452906791cc32db1fb4504e735fb","83d84abe00a2968d2dc3d52ec2f9ef764b44a91c","24b73f3a4a459c93e9b224ebd0d359793292e779","d3452b01aeb9edd59216a7f0ae19c44910b8f5af","c270cd59b32c87cbef7cf953c50e93bf62437499","ddd9cabc50723bba60f0277502ebf32da42e66ec"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mapping the initial DNA breaks in apoptotic Jurkat cells using ligation-mediated PCR","doi":"10.1038/sj.cdd.4401146","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.cdd.4401146","venue":"Cell Death and Differentiation"}

Under these conditions, there is a possibility that CO2 diffusion is blocked by water, which may lead to reduction in photosynthetic CO2 assimilation. Using Chenopodium album L. grown at two irradiances, photosynthesis, quantum yield of Photosystem II (ΔF/F m′), non-photochemical quenching (qN), and photoinhibition were compared between detached leaves and leaf discs. In low-light-grown plants, photoinhibition was greater in leaf discs than in detached leaves, while in high-light-grown plants, there was little difference. Leaf discs showed lower rates of photosynthesis and ΔF/F m′, and higher qN. The ΔF/F m′ in leaf discs increased when leaf discs were exposed to high concentration of CO2, suggesting that CO2 diffusion to chloroplasts was limited in leaf discs floated on water.","inCitations":["7f6b36df226b01b8b6ba683166b5d2bae3d350f9","e9502605c415aaab45129f4b37e52caf11592b5b","6b47c04d2da48bdebec8dd6760681017958695f0","cd96b707b6478c0eb9f8b2fd8c9d3fe5907faa89","de5c11535ee4a383737f8f75a506ac474fc1b937","297d6cd6bb4ec1e45db84723db4c58bb65f074ee","2ac80447a99ee11b795e70c6bf5eb8f014bc9f4b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Leaf discs floated on water are different from intact leaves in photosynthesis and photoinhibition","doi":"10.1023/A:1016097312036","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1016097312036","venue":"Photosynthesis Research"}

The PC evidenced statistically significant higher frequencies of families with high (38.9%) and medium (55.5%) PVI, while in the UC low PVI (93%) was the most frequent. A statistically significant higher frequency of PC children was parasitized (30.2 vs. 14.5%; χ 2 Pearson = 5.21; P < 0.05), presented higher parasite frequencies, specific richness, parasitic loads, and they also evidenced polyparasitism. The Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) showed associations between PC-parasitized children, overcrowding and contact with pets and farm animals. The ELISA test to the specified determination of Toxocara canis IgG was reactive in a statistically significant higher proportion of PC children than the UC (55 vs. 8.5%; χ 2 = 30.5; P < 0.01). The MCA associated PC reactive children, not adequate hand washing, moderate and hypereosinophilia and contact with pets and farm animals. Deficient socio-environmental conditions became children more vulnerable to get enteroparasitoses and toxocarosis in the PC than in the UC.","inCitations":["8c948be4e9b7ff377a0f5f72e9007e0a61174a7e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enteroparasitoses and Toxocarosis Affecting Children from Mar del Plata City, Argentina","doi":"10.1007/s10393-017-1238-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-017-1238-9","venue":"EcoHealth"}

Although these agents are used extensively in clinical practice, evidence to support the use of topical antimicrobial agents remains limited.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe world literature on the use of antiseptic and antibiotic agents was evaluated to determine the current status of evidence to support the use of topical antimicrobial agents in the prevention of surgical site infections.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough several techniques of using topical antibiotic solutions, powders, antibiotic gauzes, and beads have some evidence for validation, there are equal numbers of reports that have failed to show benefit. There is little evidence to support the use of antiseptic solutions in the prevention of infections at the surgical site.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdditional clinical trials are necessary to provide evidence to support any of the methods for using topical antimicrobial agents to present surgical site infections. Dilute antiseptic agents should be considered in future trials when antimicrobial activity can be identified without local toxicity.","inCitations":["2a45b9617264b0e112fb5bda96a1bc1ab5d33771","37373fcc1c9667e15e0c1677b4bafc9798726204","13622f49d910b5bd3518d5c7c7e6cac0a1db02f8"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.7sbundle.com/uploads/4/6/4/2/4642325/fry_surg_infect_2016.pdf"],"title":"Topical Antimicrobials and the Open Surgical Wound.","doi":"10.1089/sur.2016.107","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2016.107","venue":"Surgical infections"}

However, improvements are necessary for regulatory acceptance and application to high-throughput screening. We have previously reported that heart and neural crest derivatives expressed transcript 1 (Hand1), a transcription factor essential for mammalian heart development, and cardiomyopathy associated 1 (Cmya1), an intercalated disk protein implicated in cardiac morphogenesis, are quantitative and objective molecular endpoints for predicting embryotoxicity, detected at day 6 when mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiate into cardiomyocytes. In established stable transgenic ES cells with Hand1 or Cmya1 promoters upstream of luciferase reporter gene, changes in each gene expression were found to be coincident with those in luciferase activities during cardiomyocyte differentiation, suggesting that monitoring might be possible by chemiluminescent determination. In our novel EST, differentiation toxicity and cytotoxicity of test chemicals were here analyzed using ES cells and 3T3 fibroblasts by this approach in 96-microwell plates. Extensive investigations were performed to explore predictive power and validity by comparing a set of 24 well-known test chemicals. The novel EST offers high predictability and accuracy with a reduced test duration and manpower compared with the original EST protocol, thus providing a new rapid and sensitive in vitro method for screening embryotoxicants.","inCitations":["76f3234b8aefe37fe67b67d1865c55ebdac9acfe","d57338fd93161a9a4293acc7bbd7fc608e3764fe","a79a32adc39005b6a16cd43854937db664abeb26","f7eb65f64290a1ed38659164c417c1282cf81c0b","d22c87edbf9e889b2f00ef44a18340609076951b","d4edf219cc6cdf6a9b9824a271c3378c3723bed4"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/toxsci/124/2/10.1093_toxsci_kfr250/2/kfr250.pdf?Expires=1492625883&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=I~ZrokRWnEgCUuSYpHTAM8v2QN4FY9u7G~EY0K8h6FaBhEd3omepCbpXJbh3SHmYhYCUhbp5rp1yT24BVuTcEp7Sp6H30-RVE2Xik87RpoN0pcrzRabFQyia9S8bVWLCTwUHIET1prGZVDATRaAo-RhNKTn3Lv~QhBp9gWvltzJI0OERcuRFQTzCIbYjoDtUWPFmdZnextLaxzJO7R~gPuer1um9l5zpxcCOJFLvKuN-nRgH4D-nQlMxv~7elhRxQ7r97~jZ-KXepCQHJzgQG-XQ5-o2uzpP~630nIKMBFnQzKE4lgLjd1houzVt6~ij7BLtWU9SO4vUkBriDIvXiw__"],"title":"Evaluation of novel high-throughput embryonic stem cell tests with new molecular markers for screening embryotoxic chemicals in vitro.","doi":"10.1093/toxsci/kfr250","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfr250","venue":"Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology"}

MS2 capsids were loaded with approximately 250 cationic porphyrins through a novel assembly packaging mechanism, followed by exterior decoration of the capsid with a cancer-targeting nucleic acid aptamer via chemical conjugation. The ability of these aptamer-virus-porphyrin constructs to specifically target and eradicate MCF-7 human breast cancer cells upon photoactivation was assessed. Photoinduced cytotoxicity was evaluated via live/dead staining and a metabolic activity assay with MCF-10A cells as a control. Results show that MCF-7 cells incubated with targeted, porphyrin-loaded virus capsids exhibited cell death whereas the MCF-10A cells did not. Furthermore, MCF-7 cells incubated with porphyrin-loaded viruses decorated with a non-targeting aptamer exhibited no observable phototoxicity. Combined, the results presented in this work demonstrate our unique virus-based loading strategy offers a viable approach for efficient targeted delivery of photoactive compounds for site-specific photodynamic cancer therapy using bio-derived nanomaterials.","inCitations":["1c42b175f12adf40aa00004ef2358078a7028bd5","84f75b955d273fe2c4045468a9b1b0af24324db3","66952096e5ce510674ade37687c31a741f4ebfe5","e23e8165b55137b30c19626e108e62ce3837aef5","12e90d05f1f99c80e8e2dc2dd7705f132712d6cd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Targeted in vitro photodynamic therapy via aptamer-labeled, porphyrin-loaded virus capsids.","doi":"10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2013.02.013","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2013.02.013","venue":"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

Each engineering design characteristic is maximized for product performance according to the level of customer satisfaction. To cope with the vague nature of product development processes, fuzzy approaches are used to represent the importance scores of customer requirements (CRs), the relationship between CRs and design requirements (DRs) and relationship between the DRs themselves. Considering Kano’s category of design requirements, this paper extends Chen and Weng’s model (2003), and presents a fuzzy nonlinear model to determine the performance level of each DR for maximizing customer satisfaction, under the same group of constraints as that in Chen and Weng’s model. The results, from an illustrative example, indicate that the total degree of customer satisfaction achieved by the proposed nonlinear model is greater than that by the original fuzzy model. c © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we demonstrate the theranostics nanodevices on the basis of Cu2+-loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (CuPDA NPs), which are able to offer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided thermochemotherapy (TCT). Systematical studies reveal that after Cu2+ ions loading, the molar extinction coefficient of PDA NPs is greatly enhanced by 4 times, thus improving the performance in photothermal therapy. Despite Cu2+ ions being toxic, the release of Cu2+ is mainly stimulated in acidic environment. Once the NPs deposit in the slightly acidic tumor microenvironment (pH ≈ 6.5-6.8), the release rate boosts ∼30%, which effectively avoids the systematic toxicity during chemotherapy. Meanwhile, due to the increment of the electron-proton dipole-dipole interaction correlation time τC, the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) for PDA NPs is found to be shortened by Cu2+ loading, which boosts the longitudinal relaxivity (r1). Hence, CuPDA NPs can be used as T1-weighted contrast agent in MRI. In addition, due to the naturally existing DA in the human body with stealth effect, CuPDA NPs have an outstanding tumor retention rate as high as 8.2% ID/g. Further in vitro and in vivo tests indicate that CuPDA NPs possess long blood circulation time, good photothermal and physiological stability, and biocompatibility, which are potential nanodevices for MRI-guided TCT with minimal side effects.","inCitations":["8241ca01f4ae7f49a15dd9c4eba7924d86683284","a6a2f0c754774792a53f3b0ac4ab0f2552ce7764"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cu2+-Loaded Polydopamine Nanoparticles for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided pH- and Near-Infrared-Light-Stimulated Thermochemotherapy.","doi":"10.1021/acsami.7b05583","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b05583","venue":"ACS applied materials & interfaces"}

We hereby report a case of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to airway obstruction in HAE. Cutaneous swelling and abdominal pain attacks caused by gastrointestinal wall swelling are common symptoms in HAE, whereas laryngeal swelling is rare. Emergency physicians may have few chances to experience cases of life-threatening laryngeal edema resulting in a delay from symptom onset to the diagnosis of HAE. Hereditary angioedema is diagnosed by performing complement blood tests. Because safe and effective treatment options are available for the life-threatening swellings in HAE, the diagnosis potentially reduces the risk of asphyxiation in patients and their blood relatives.","inCitations":["3e2194d39de05f40978db4c79aede1f89b7b8d12"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cardiac arrest due to airway obstruction in hereditary angioedema.","doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2015.04.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2015.04.003","venue":"The American journal of emergency medicine"}

In C. elegans zygotes, MBK-2/DYRK phosphorylates oocyte proteins at the end of the meiotic divisions to promote the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Here we demonstrate that MBK-2 is under both positive and negative regulation during the transition. MBK-2 is activated during oocyte maturation by CDK-1-dependent phosphorylation of serine 68, a residue outside of the kinase domain required for full activity in vivo. The pseudotyrosine phosphatases EGG-4 and EGG-5 sequester activated MBK-2 until the meiotic divisions by binding to the YTY motif and inhibiting MBK-2's kinase activity directly, using a mixed-inhibition mechanism that does not involve tyrosine dephosphorylation. Our findings link cell-cycle progression to MBK-2/DYRK activation and the oocyte-to-embryo transition.","inCitations":["84c5155a149d837ebe785a952b76d4602aaa794a","f2b461708cdc6df9f32afbf049252ea4861a22e4","f6dcc47ae75861ac51a18a0efce31985320cde31","1eae6b2b3a4054c1241b805f7d350a775f713d02","3de9ef15291d46b96c25f5ee87e43e34cb0d79cc","d52642bc920c3c333e3f7076917f6740003bd305","0e66baa93c31e10a2f2022b0ad9b5b7be2d4aaae","238199d0a9465125984456a2b9e90e671096f478","2eb99d817f3d9bd72739893e576929814d05daa8","f5a8e5d32090b62104f7d342aadc9849a24bae52","0112267c6891690ad206903486182848c3e3ebe6","0ec78c4d7006d90893a87848a6fccd52d1f60f1b","4f97ab30c6ac4b7cc46f7757875e5dce06f3afae","c2958cab7d365e6327ecfdf84882f85226a93252","4d17a1fc4be0b6a7f9145717fe1e3f7ed96539c2","4df93f27cdda96f853a7e4df8452704615117217","3bbfdfbc7011a68bc45f2c1178bb19127cda7cd7","a902c484034ad48d778c5d4a227d0c0065b31c77","a1a22a360c2c2268a7b99f73f6280f19faba417c","585a171d5128e66ea20c0808b8e030b813a6ff63","953b08d0f1c88957cef547ecc3c5e6be1b1c148e","8d18f98e28bb0d7ac592b31c9dfea0779b503c63","1f8059ef44483e369cb9c7cf4cdf26de2feda43e","511b24f65a3fb6de1d16061df2816237d3d97188","36cd0a4d185c5b76316e336f384c2a407bcf17d0","33f40d2e7f1244375b7cfb23030ebf187935a087","ec679c739a6a93c1cf8f45860e429b5f2b9f9f56","2b1ac8ba9161ed4b032a9f2ab006aa0087ac41f4","c826f105b2d5e8c8be4b17b74e50750ca0e595c9","391146fc5150b1646a00fd7497353821b471a53a","ddd2fccc1f08ca001fd507d88b0a4962c40eacaf","3591ac049bd5a4fac1dc9ee730675ebf42e2b5c6","135a71e93d11606ff2cff53548aced1461629ac2","f57d00a615e789a6afe8730e702c2654a8f39c26","72ca4333c4fff5dfd62d00114126220cdc0579c0"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867409011878","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867409011878"],"title":"Regulation of MBK-2/DYRK by CDK-1 and the Pseudophosphatases EGG-4 and EGG-5 during the Oocyte-to-Embryo Transition","doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.047","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.047","venue":"Cell"}

In addition to their beneficial N2-fixing activity with legumes, rhizobia can improve plant P nutrition by mobilizing inorganic and organic P. Isolates from different cross-inoculation groups of rhizobia, obtained from Iranian soils were tested for their ability to dissolve inorganic and organic phosphate. From a total of 446 rhizobial isolates tested for P solubilization by the formation of visible dissolution halos on agar plates, 198 (44%) and 341(76%) of the isolates, solubilized Ca3(PO4)2 (TCP) and inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), respectively. In the liquid Sperber TCP medium, phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens) used as positive controls released an average of 268.6 mg L−1 of P after 360 h incubation. This amount was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those observed with all rhizobia tested. The group of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae mobilized in liquid TCP Sperber medium significantly (P < 0.05) more P (197.1 mg L−1 in 360 h) than other rhizobia tested,. This group also showed the highest dissolution halo on the TCP solid Sperber medium. The release of soluble P was significantly correlated with a drop in the pH of the culture filtrates indicating the importance of acid production in the mobilization process. None of the 70 bradyrhizobial isolates tested was able to solubilize TCP. These results indicate that many rhizobia isolated from soils in Iran are able to mobilize P from organic and inorganic sources and this beneficial effect should be tested with crops grown in Iran.","inCitations":["577aa4435f2177cc154a8338e3ba067ed35d6a59","2748a761afa2cbca83f0ba68ec225929362e839d","cdde525a3374113ac182f97226d45042b74d5d15","5a6fdf2d301e1790efec195efa063bfb4d377178","4264cb44d703bec090914343fd5779de509bad13","8c6341180039255945e55ffc0e76e8a1b3e51d23","dcfdb209b6658f14fa1f033add4b822c07344c5f","b3aa93cc0dfb205874ba3c5191c1fdfbc65d194b","f68166a36d35549688f29a0fe50415369bf96766","5d09a2f53c449170587cbff53c521cca106f92b9","4e356aa028f1c83b0737dc567e425aa38f9c8538","a363ac162609c5975a9a30180faef842848fa265","e6cb9df5fb75305d916cc8fef8c6af1e53ef8823","a8a7b178b9e950c8e9f681a0cd7ffc712ae1ced2","a3a1ea406c1ee5998037df8967f1446a35da2d88","eb15d69999a0acb642c2d05737f04a6d306d4a86","24cd56fb11bf013f13aeb2214abd51edff5e67c8","953d644f5f6545cdb6435861bcfb22b950bc86dc","74b559f92f3157a9ed2167ad6c4f33171a008521","4bd87791af3a7e8cb1cd165e22bd6b67b47c7aca","3810fd1251fea4ead7e9bf7f4ad1eb9f7b01c58c","41190f8e0b11c6a8a1bbaad2fe62b857920260a4","bd56bb0bc0f1929479b9908ba5eb79639d7811c4","578e3f480a7420b47b31c1697ff1e1edb9048f39","ea0c16188076d89ca0ae91d93fc87ff27995c210","4ec7a3b71f7a2d30a98fdfd762e2d215d6ce2c38","f60943e02357e974dcaa1a3a725b2fe3080903fc","1603b5923a74b77c050ca2edfd161e5f3669f515"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.bashanfoundation.org/hani/hanirhizobiairanian.pdf"],"title":"Phosphate solubilization activity of rhizobia native to Iranian soils","doi":"10.1007/s11104-006-9059-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-006-9059-6","venue":"Plant and Soil"}

Reports are limited for this rare entity in the antibiotics era but increase during past decade. We had clinical analysis of a series with six consecutive pediatric patients of Pott’s puffy tumor during 20 years in a tertiary medical center via retrospective chart review. One case was described in detail. Male-to-female ratio was 5:1. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 13 years–3 months. The risk factors were acute sinusitis in two (33%), chronic sinusitis in two (33%), recent head trauma in two (33%), and acupuncture therapy on skull in one (17%). The commonest presenting symptoms were fever, headache, forehead tenderness, vomiting, and fatigue/malaise (100%). Pott’s puffy tumor was diagnosed on average the seventh day after fever, and half had intracranial involvement at diagnosis. All had intracranial infections, and most of them had subdural empyema. The most often involved sinus was frontal sinus (100%). The frontal lobe was the most common site of intracranial infection (100%), two thirds of which are polymicrobial from two or more sites. The initial operation was performed on average on the 5.8th days after diagnosis. Half of the patients underwent reoperation. The mortality rate was 17% (one of six). The symptoms of Pott’s puffy tumor are inconspicuous even though early intracranial involvement often occurred. The importance of early diagnosis and aggravated and prompt treatment with prolonged antibiotic therapy is emphasized for better outcome.","inCitations":["8718af9335a1d768699d1c0feb7bc359883b226d","a5b0ea9b95d109da07fbd935395134c63380cde5","71312da2db190a659f925861547b298b8302f482","571aa8a19269799e561a135113e6843e51735257","d0ecb91f30a5581f823d07299a8efb00a168b279","dab6404577a5f94a9d234d82e715564943e83475","832e1c019b8dbe17686aed0e36e3fdd165832e67","0183f951847ecb4b918781e6a82ce003f0150866","71cf7c8bc868f958d535529e2d3b3882827929f6","00fb6eabc7df9e220f891414920774673c627eb4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pott’s puffy tumor in children","doi":"10.1007/s00381-009-0954-z","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-009-0954-z","venue":"Child's Nervous System"}

Two independent readers who were blinded to clinical outcomes scored pulmonary artery obstructions, evaluated cardiovascular measurements, and assessed qualitative findings. Reports of echocardiographic, clinical, and laboratory findings and clinical outcome were reviewed. Results were correlated with patient outcomes using Wilcoxon's rank-sum, χ², and Student's t tests. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of patient outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirteen patients (11%) died related to PE within 30 days in the hospital. There were significant differences in the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fraction of oxygen and in heart rate between survivors and nonsurvivors (P < .05). No CT or echocardiographic predictor was associated with mortality.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fraction of oxygen and heart rate strongly predicted mortality due to PE. Neither CT pulmonary angiographic variables nor echocardiography could successfully predict in-hospital mortality in patients with acute PE.","inCitations":["4d0a85a1e994e086aa329e7b70892570c87fa50e","8fc52dec8127ce26e45a0d1a631df6745848607b","29c2bf561f40d8e99335f9098576fb1e8b348b61","504bb7fd5303eb7341810af747dcb4cc01dfe347","85da4cb682bf66a10f1b6587ebb89e6ca7ec64fb","1cd7ba7458b88847016e84d98571b493c28bedc6","89efae279d375f69723ef6b345538068db4bac5a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Predictors of clinical outcome in acute pulmonary embolism: Correlation of CT pulmonary angiography with clinical, echocardiography and laboratory findings.","doi":"10.1016/j.acra.2010.08.024","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2010.08.024","venue":"Academic radiology"}

Based on the fact that most UWB channels are highly uncorrelated, we can formulate a CMDA-like signal processing model for an asynchronous multiuser system.

Learning model developments that place greater weight on laboratory activities require investment in specific equipment that is often very expensive, difficult to manage, and soon obsolete. This paper describes a virtual laboratory education platform, QoSLab, for training in and research into quality-of-service (QoS) mechanisms used for Metro Ethernet access in next-generation networks (NGNs). QoSLab integrates three experiments and 21 tasks with a pedagogical model to help students achieve learning goals; it also promoting student teamwork, iteration with lecturers, and autonomy. QoSLab was developed using OMNeT++, an open-source framework environment that allows students to run the code on their personal computers. Evaluations have shown that since 2013, QoSLab has produced a significant increase in student grades on NGN-related topics, as well as good results in student satisfaction surveys.","inCitations":["a92df254b46fef836816db9e16cf4d94956be99e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2015.2498120"],"title":"Virtual Laboratory for QoS Study in Next-Generation Networks With Metro Ethernet Access","doi":"10.1109/TE.2015.2498120","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2015.2498120","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Education"}

In motion and active vibration control applications, for example, these nonlinearities can excite unwanted dynamics which leads in the best case to reduced closed-loop system performance and in the worst case to unstable closed-loop system operation. This necessitates the development of purely phenomenological models which characterize these types of nonlinearities and dynamics in a way which is sufficiently accurate, robust, amenable to control design for compensation and efficient enough for use in real-time applications. To fulfil these demanding requirements the present paper describes a new compensator design method for combined complex hysteretic nonlinearities and complex log(t)-type creep dynamics based on the so-called PrandtlIshlinskii approach. The underlying parameter identification problem which has to be solved to obtain a suitable compensator can be represented by a quadratic optimization problem which produces the best least-square approximation for the measured input-output data of the","inCitations":["0c0f5d09481d263b5e1dc95a87d97af085e37917","ed7f7f72ced247f90764f5fbb2cad372d801820a","46351d4e2eeb899e866d867647f2c8ede67efc52","4e2aaa35a1a22916f1f11facca43d5af3303ac7b","bbd41a65279450e804e5766f6ae54fdf4bab772e","b927bb7a56440348048b2d5807871c6593cd8dce","71bad1a6d557d7ed3dd11d6f40ce69e4ef218c0a","b8fca6b0aba1e84a45bdd036cb89fbd71ee6a65d","eb77fef574d20d3373a4d680365a51795a9de117","21661fee413974c25815dc21974283cdb3dbf5de","3b7a0a96a7e48ef1087e9cbeac6d3bcffc7e0b76","de49f9e0df5d38f6297086d65b29e1dfd5d6ffd5","29c1223a07fad725cb615ef93f8f421156750412","57c019c0c984900135bbec8306633129d8576bce"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.klauskuhnen.de/images/pdf/cis05.pdf","https://doi.org/10.2316/Journal.201.2005.2.201-1420"],"title":"Modelling, Identification, and Compensation of Complex Hysteretic and log(t)-Type Creep Nonlinearities","doi":"10.2316/Journal.201.2005.2.201-1420","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2316/Journal.201.2005.2.201-1420","venue":"Control and Intelligent Systems"}

However, certain intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania can successfully manipulate the TLR signaling, thus hijacking the defensive strategies of the host. Despite the presence of lipophosphoglycan, a TLR2 ligand capable of eliciting host-defensive cytokine response, on the surface of Leishmania, the strategies adopted by the parasite to silence the TLR2-mediated proinflammatory response is not understood. In this study, we showed that Leishmania donovani modulates the TLR2-mediated pathway in macrophages through inhibition of the IKK-NF-κB cascade and suppression of IL-12 and TNF-α production. This may be due to impairment of the association of TRAF6 with the TAK-TAB complex, thus inhibiting the recruitment of TRAF6 in TLR2 signaling. L. donovani infection drastically reduced Lys 63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6, and the deubiquitinating enzyme A20 was found to be significantly upregulated in infected macrophages. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of A20 restored the Lys 63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 as well as IL-12 and TNF-α levels with a concomitant decrease in IL-10 and TGF-β synthesis in infected macrophages. Knockdown of A20 led to lower parasite survival within macrophages. Moreover, in vivo silencing of A20 by short hairpin RNA in BALB/c mice led to increased NF-κB DNA binding and host-protective proinflammatory cytokine response resulting in effective parasite clearance. These results suggest that L. donovani might exploit host A20 to inhibit the TLR2-mediated proinflammatory gene expression, thus escaping the immune responses of the host.","inCitations":["301b725d742f505825853a53a79348121080152e","bb1c6d483b4691ec4b70021c5c9543cfa4a35b82","acb4281afa2ec9d52ccd311f390c08e63c36a8ac","e457f0cf097cc45c95fb0363a19fab50739e6513","93281222abd53459d6c950073ef75277cf4ddaa4","3445acf33cee3459c86b59afcad40ef2c1962f4b","7a9161daf1d9399b4c5bb95b5b9042083ff5ddd6","c6105a846c32b4fd185ad21d5b2acfe3e0fe04ae","06ae798ecf43af61024e392485c2ed712142cb87","935bac3837f08539bc584da539062569e1271ee2","e55839c7c9a91337e5e637427a11a7e5ad0f4633","e46c2f427c20b2e3e06ae87cd2d7bb1fe66b12b7","7726054cc7f8582fd72e3c0bca9582b44394e5cf","982c80e444cb4fa900954f3dfd3e345db2c2fd96","abf5aa7a8934d98e801e6a48625708e49f1fdeb4","9f12a9570477a9ec95ac75ba4076d160b96d2200","9d5dab098e7aedb601a2debc02d6263643612af8","acdea4201b9abfdd99a900369d09de7c7e4f50f6","7a3cd5ac385fdf5902cb91a3774c92fa4de2ad12","23adce5f44c51f03ff43a09bb15a2229761129a2","5951d45daf81f06816af82da7a10e31892dfa5cc","a1b13d800582f4c7d1245ae99ea223d69e337809","b2f1b85322562b37e5513cab9eff3d51b475e95c","d46c3fccdcee4cbd646801d099d8d83e8b16b777"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/early/2012/06/08/jimmunol.1102845.full.pdf","http://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/189/2/924.full.pdf"],"title":"Leishmania donovani exploits host deubiquitinating enzyme A20, a negative regulator of TLR signaling, to subvert host immune response.","doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.1102845","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1102845","venue":"Journal of immunology"}

This is a normative problem on which people differ in opinion, and hence we should seek a way of dealing with the issue that takes into account this plurality. In the paper, we suggest an approach to poverty measurement which avoids incorporating any particular normative position on how to weigh the interests of various poor groups, but rather reports on changes in poverty by making explicit the link between various normative positions and ordinal conclusions in poverty measurement.

While only few neurons projected to the dorsal column nuclear complex, numerous cells were found to give rise to spinal projections. Rubro-spinal neurons of various sizes were distributed over the entire rostrocaudal extent of the contra-lateral nucleus; a few neurons were also located ipsilaterally. Unlike that of the opossum, the projection appeared to be somatotopically organised. Interstitio-spinal neurons were differentiated into several subpopulations according to their location and laterality of projection. In the ipsilateral periventricular grey, in addition, there was a distinct population of cells possibly corresponding to the nucleus of Darkschewitsch. The mesencephalic central grey contained relatively few labeled neurons, the great majority of them being mesencephalic trigeminal, ectopic cuneiform or midline cells. Labeled cuneiform and midline cells, on the other hand, were quite numerous, extending both from a level just caudal to the trochlear nucleus to levels far beyond the rostral tip of the somatic oculomotor nucleus. The discrepancy between the poorly differentiated oculomotor nuclei and the apparently well-developed Edinger-Westphal complex is discussed. Hypothalamo-spinal neurons were essentially restricted to dorsal regions: the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PAV), the dorso-medial (DmHy) and dorso-intermediate cell groups as well as the lateral hypothalamic zone. The latter two cell groups were bilaterally labeled, while the labeled neurons in DmHy and PAV were located predominantly ipsilaterally. Labeled neurons in the amygdala, colliculus superior and mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus were only found following cervical injections; all other mentioned areas and the posterior commissure complex projected to, at least, midthoracic level.","inCitations":["36cbf9c634bff57bd10579ab3de16a6f6033bb89"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Meso-diencephalic regions projecting to spinal cord and dorsal column nuclear complex in the hedgehog-tenrec, Echinops telfairi","doi":"10.1007/BF00213601","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00213601","venue":"Anatomy and Embryology"}

We have recently reported families with BrS and SCN5A mutations where some affected members do not carry the familial mutation. We evaluated the involvement of additional genetic determinants for BrS in an affected family. We identified three distinct gene variants within a family presenting BrS (5 individuals), cardiac conduction defects (CCD, 3 individuals) and shortened QT interval (4 individuals). The first mutation is nonsense, p.Q1695*, lying within the SCN5A gene, which encodes for NaV1.5, the α–subunit of the cardiac Na+ channel. The second mutation is missense, p.N300D, and alters the CACNA1C gene, which encodes the α–subunit CaV1.2 of the L-type cardiac Ca2+ channel. The SCN5A mutation strictly segregates with CCD. Four out of the 5 BrS patients carry the CACNA1C variant, and three of them present shortened QT interval. One of the BrS patients carries none of these mutations but a rare variant located in the ABCC9 gene as well as his asymptomatic mother. Patch-clamp studies identified a loss-of-function of the mutated CaV1.2 channel. Western-blot experiments showed a global expression defect while increased mobility of CaV1.2 channels on cell surface was revealed by FRAP experiments. Finally, computer simulations of the two mutations recapitulated patient phenotypes. We report a rare CACNA1C mutation as causing BrS and/or shortened QT interval in a family also carrying a SCN5A stop mutation, but which does not segregate with BrS. This study underlies the complexity of BrS inheritance and its pre-symptomatic genetic screening interpretation.","inCitations":["68b036990e5f09d6aaa64dc894afca6be1efb5ec","ef564536f2f2e26e597d386f8312c851671e5189","715a600246e8790d761c92d01ca9d271cc619996","bbfeeba5263f5838bcf30f2d041bd5357724d375"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Complex Brugada syndrome inheritance in a family harbouring compound SCN5A and CACNA1C mutations","doi":"10.1007/s00395-014-0446-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00395-014-0446-5","venue":"Basic Research in Cardiology"}

Usually, according to their roles and responsibilities, users are organized in hierarchies formed by a certain number of disjoint classes. Such hierarchies are implemented by assigning a key to each class, so that the keys for descendant classes can be efficiently derived from classes higher in the hierarchy. However, pure hierarchical access may represent a limitation in many real-world cases. In fact, sometimes it is necessary to ensure access to a resource or task by considering both its directly responsible user and a group of users possessing certain credentials. In this paper, we first propose a novel model that generalizes the conventional hierarchical access control paradigm, by extending it to certain additional sets of qualified users. Afterward, we propose two constructions for hierarchical key assignment schemes in this new model, which are provably secure with respect to key indistinguishability. In particular, the former construction relies on both symmetric encryption and perfect secret sharing, whereas, the latter is based on public-key threshold broadcast encryption.","inCitations":["78a4d1f70807f8a8b11a82636e8132c655d991cb","8a1fd30b8db1f6bd3c643b066bf2507a7431d685","885cd7b76948337e91f2a276a9380de2619c70f4","080b786fa1137f3ecaa6f85392c3ead7a7d65044","047b07f1f5dfafcefbcbd9d245e5dab8d7b7ffa0","2e7c6a016e1a1c76396efb492d47b191526624f8","42be2982bd8af1ab0051daab061ddf9bb33d6a9a","facc06634442b26448d8db80b6ad33688000435d","31edf4bc73c14f76618adb9c5e5201064bdab48e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512533"],"title":"Hierarchical and Shared Access Control","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512533","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512533","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security"}

We now report on Rockport virus (RKPV), a hantavirus identified in archival tissues of the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) collected in Rockport, TX, in 1986. Pairwise comparison of the full-length S, M, and L genomic segments indicated moderately low sequence similarity between RKPV and other soricomorph-borne hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses, using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, showed that RKPV shared a most recent common ancestor with cricetid-rodent-borne hantaviruses. Distributed widely across the eastern United States, the fossorial eastern mole is sympatric and syntopic with cricetid rodents known to harbor hantaviruses, raising the possibility of host-switching events in the distant past. Our findings warrant more-detailed investigations on the dynamics of spillover and cross-species transmission of present-day hantaviruses within communities of rodents and moles.","inCitations":["cbe3da725baab8d5a001a7d10e43a75d77b21da5","6794e5670dda4ba95d0c0b84ba357ad70d3614cc","8b588117f5adc9cbec0e4bdf18f7c63e5de3a18b","e359c57406d8ba17cfa7b901dbc7626f88c4f68a","8d1a4b5f75707ce521ba1b773fff0fd3d6d40a07","87834d999eba9c6412ed7e404c7756f00402135f","bf6b185d7d9abdcf92731bcb940a4a136c22bb91","bd478a4e2a757675977f888305f28f5dcc6dc750","74fcf1c084b498b4e6ad8745df80c9a9ae300a2c","ee8d92e196dbfca82c9da5a746eaabe989705eb8","467143e07e3d6ec8a0617a5bdee446ab2c63581c","b5df4b8bc8b9b37934ef952656c2eda5dc6e020a","4c64141ee2dccbb100ff9b9748eb10c89caa1341","d2309803be26435a9b16efcc8886b70435309543","8f3ca71a72f06c4806a138775118f7c3b7c7ce55","a61398ab9aa3533ffab5ad976b4da1e0c856c836","50e19c5dc4c5f5934e19be3082fb5aca082870fb","271fbaca65f2d64c21ebc2994779c11dc049d171","d9c0e0009c1f8176e52d37ae627bedd4c4042ab4","8d28ac836875e31c0a2facd9db584d048eafeade","82f4bce16669387c360d7de78f7382d0d0bfbb8c","451b2691e8d180a156517c9f2094e78a395ecb9e","984f0b4e1dce9c86859de014679b8f9a6115524a","0f491b223378ac64baf84b07de60d96500e05452","87bcb05857639484098f1bd46a16f95d00043861","1ac4cbeabeab898963793511731c21b48f25a873"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.msb.unm.edu/mammals/documents/Kangetal-2011-J.Virol.Mole-Cricetidhanta.pdf"],"title":"Shared ancestry between a newfound mole-borne hantavirus and hantaviruses harbored by cricetid rodents.","doi":"10.1128/JVI.02450-10","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02450-10","venue":"Journal of virology"}

Changes in the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Fas, progesterone receptor (PRA) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe cell proliferation index was significantly reduced in the epithelium and stroma of both the eutopic and the ectopic endometrium after treatment with the LNG-IUS and GnRHa. Only LNG-IUS users showed an increased H-score for Fas in the epithelium of the eutopic and ectopic endometrium (P < 0.05). Expression of ER-alpha and PRA by the glandular epithelium was lower in the eutopic endometrium after both treatments, but this reduction was noted in the ectopic endometrium only after LNG-IUS treatments (P < 0.05). No difference was detected between groups for any of the markers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLNG-IUS reduced both cell proliferation and the expression of PRA and ER-alpha and increased Fas expression in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis. Some of these actions were not observed with GnRHa.","inCitations":["8f3f2448935aec41352db6103da37b314bc2ab32","1564a43cae45ec7c1e4564109fde88142f0a2e32","4b05da08c915c474028b0ea87bc349a25a6f6e39","d1fe0c8ce1b29bfc64436d44f08191eedc45e66a","ed9070242b4a90f07bdd8ef1e45e4d70a9aae21b","ceea4a1faa594142fbbeb2da4302c2454d0faade","c2dc50395a0f6fae27b27da69ef282a6a6f3d5b8","6d4820fdd020d3ba881a1c6f68ebaa48a055fe39","efae56acaae020997cef4f79914e3848be861b90","98331c4db84eddcafc31ed043e943a2be0555e5d","e03d89da3056a1ad7db160982d4493800d07c538"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/humrep/24/11/10.1093/humrep/dep288/2/dep288.pdf?Expires=1492424269&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=cQajo9~a-o8IJhGEtRY0RZoXW5-gN-dmAK3iWkgh5hpI6E5l83JWRBv4Cighe68KK3i2PFEMjVpORnIis7HCDLKxZpt5KjnSRvPHhzCzmn7CY-JNj70sh2lPRqYJAt5z2j7e0S6-CMD4muk-Z8c50elkq4FeoQQea~MVMAuYcdjKihk5eWX3GJxjwKX1dY1ld9eQBkM2Bi7Ixq-nDxF9IQzz44omVfkiHKW1v-BFAKBJW04R5UYKm2geit2eOFKdf1DVhQQBi2zMzr4Egv73cJN-J74IdgPpxASrYbwWZA35RXmF2jlbs2UUTvIowowBOhv3l8~5ZouFu8XGHi7ltQ__"],"title":"Effects of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system on cell proliferation, Fas expression and steroid receptors in endometriosis lesions and normal endometrium.","doi":"10.1093/humrep/dep288","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dep288","venue":"Human reproduction"}

Data on wheeze were collected by questionnaire and atopy was measured by allergen skin prick test reactivity to 10 allergens at 5 years. Stool samples from mothers and children were examined for geohelminths by microscopy.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nA total of 2,090 (86.9%) children were evaluated at 5 years. Geohelminths were observed in 45.5% of mothers and in 34.1% of children by 3 years. Wheeze and asthma were reported for 12.6% and 5.7% of children, respectively, whereas 14.0% had skin test reactivity at 5 years. Maternal geohelminths were associated with an increased risk of wheeze (adjusted odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.88), whereas childhood geohelminths over the first 3 years of life were associated with reduced risk of wheeze (adjusted odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.96) and asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.94) but not skin prick test reactivity. The effects on wheeze/asthma were greatest with later age of first infection, were observed only in skin test-negative children, but were not associated with parasite burden or specific geohelminths.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough maternal exposures to geohelminths may increase childhood wheeze, childhood geohelminths during the first 3 years may provide protection through a nonallergic mechanism.

Similar to the situation in single skeletal muscle fibres maximum speed of shortening and maximum contractile force in myocardium are altered in parallel as the state of activity is changed. Various inotropic interventions affect the force-velocity relation in the same way as occurs when the activity is altered during the course of the contraction. These findings support the view that activator-calcium governs both thenumber of active crossbridges between the A and I filaments during tension development and therate of turnover of the myosin bridges during shortening at zero load. Die momentane Kraft-Geschwindigkeit-Kurve des Warmblütermyokards weist wie diejenige des Skelettmuskels einen hyperbolischen Verlauf auf. Entsprechend dem Verhalten der Skelettmuskeleinzelfaser ändern sich die maximale Verkürzungsgeschwindigkeit und die maximale Kontraktionskraft des Myokards parallel zu Änderungen im Aktivitätszustand.

Morphine was microinjected into the Sm, which produced a dose-dependent inhibition of mirror-image allodynia; this effect was antagonized by pretreatment with non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Microinjections of endomorphin-1 (μ-receptor agonist), or [d-Ala2, d-Leu5]-enkephalin (DADLE, δ-/μ-receptor agonist), also inhibited mirror-image allodynia, and these effects were blocked by the selective μ-receptor antagonist, β-funaltrexamine hydrochloride. The DADLE-induced inhibition, however, was not influenced by the δ-receptor antagonist naltrindole. The κ-receptor agonist, spiradoline mesylate salt, failed to alter the mirror-image allodynia. These results suggest that Sm opioid receptor signaling is involved in inhibition of mirror-image allodynia; this effect is mediated by μ- (but not δ- and κ-) opioid receptors in the rat model of neuropathic pain.","inCitations":["ce92a31468335b43d1115e151910bff787e0beee","38b6ba978fe05919eaeadd7b23b8ca3bb3449900","bd9a207c35616c3c9fe67f7885ee639237b38619"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mu-Opioid Receptor in the Nucleus Submedius: Involvement in Opioid-Induced Inhibition of Mirror-Image Allodynia in a Rat Model of Neuropathic Pain","doi":"10.1007/s11064-008-9733-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-008-9733-6","venue":"Neurochemical Research"}

The characteristics of biomass-oxygen gasification in a bench-scale laminar entrained-flow gasifier were studied in the paper. Experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of some key factors, including reaction temperature, residence time and oxygen/biomass ratio, on the gasification. The results indicated that higher temperature favored H2 and CO production. Cold gas efficiency was improved by N10% when the temperature was increased from 1000 to 1400 degrees C. The carbon conversion increased and the syngas quality was improved with increasing residence time. A shorter residence resulted in incomplete gasification. An optimal residence time of 1.6 s was identified in this study. The introduction of oxygen to the gasifier strengthened the gasification and improved the carbon conversion, but lowered the lower heating value and the H2/CO ratio of the syngas. The optimal oxygen/biomass ratio in this study was 0.4. The results of this study will help to improve our understanding of syngas production by biomass high-temperature gasification.","inCitations":["3cd3a19ebc70bbdefebffa211e881d29cb2f5a4f","b4f4577972db9d1be22ffc267e0dd657a86c2e85","391eb39d832fcea609f368cc88f2512a210c00b2","2d8284c8db423cee557c717316f38fe8b6152816"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biomass-oxygen gasification in a high-temperature entrained-flow gasifier.","doi":"10.1016/j.biotechadv.2009.04.011","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2009.04.011","venue":"Biotechnology advances"}

But one has to choose a good compromise for the size of the blocks (to achieve a good computation and communication eeciency and a good load balancing). This choice heavily depends on each operation, so it is essential to be able to go from one block cyclic distribution to another very quickly. Moreover, it is also essential to be able to choose the right number of processors and the best grid shape for a given operation. We present here the data redistribution algorithms we implemented in the ScaLAPACK library in order to go from one block cyclic distribution on a grid to another one on another grid. A complexity study is made that shows the eeciency of our solution. Timing results on the Intel Paragon and the Cray T3D corroborate our results.","inCitations":["5fd4c79bb043b2584e6f93cb6ed8a297c1db787a","6dfdd7ce60e760a12c0cd4c3a524cd4e4e062cb1","309039110a2ca47bc028a8cbc8066e5c5b7e9185","db7242b127858f1cd7baefe27c8d2f252e1206b9","395cc985d7d6c32b3d4a5da18bdd69f487c9bde5","1f63b8f323a6f4b3d580fd4a267a3e9f6d1a653e","6eabb8a38a6f1cbea07bf24ea70113d125c47d98","3eb6182bad2a03baf6f29b994a7990eb3161d22f","f65eb624ef099a18ee8fd0eb646cad253d6de5f4","36a383c3aef400771a76bbd310ed4f8aeb1cc05e","41f3980438a000f40954445a1525b144c19230eb","555d01be0e0bf00b6aeb9bf67d9e8e124fa74a01","0903e2fcdad6e9b71dbcec33ca0cbb811146edda","1d7ca4e7592d450f58083d2d8ca1c76194b7a797","7ee8b8c74a3414980ceea5b6b76758a5afa8714d","3001ba365f05700f38596893c64c9c856a5fa077","0932c86305f68e5ab293603a1a308e3fbfec3226","8b2c180c687814a72a8e1f4738502efab2d27deb","1c71f7793a019a85f0a4ca14cde0987ca0db445e","d204a45668607a0c9530fcf6a34c3104809afd55","2c3b5079abd041c1563aba902d74b23bc12e4392","96dea074949ab02aed5ee7e14d9982a7dc924028","3293275d854127e8b10df65fd90cde2d8209ba6b","84bf542e48c6a7eb2868490bd52d3c78b30bc348","3d25f964f5a18c34f66e7a697094ce48ade3badd","d3a28907f86caa214491314c970454f21b422745","ec0c385edaba450464b52b4444c7abf3f10c2059","ed22070b84d3cb6f6943a55cbfd67e2568c4e085","dd58d81dd18bf97df89f853b12c5632f9507e208","28171236bf0da089c69aa32953839594f7399d0e","037d92215bc158d53e3e659b48ab56e3b030205f"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1006/jpdc.1997.1351","http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/PUBLICATIONS/pub/PT97.ps.gz"],"title":"Fast Runtime Block Cyclic Data Redistribution on Multiprocessors","doi":"10.1006/jpdc.1997.1351","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1006/jpdc.1997.1351","venue":"J.

In this paper, we extend the DFRFT to have N order parameters, where N is the number of the input data points. The proposed multiple-parameter discrete fractional Fourier transform (MPDFRFT) is shown to have all of the desired properties for fractional transforms. In fact, the MPDFRFT reduces to the DFRFT when all of its order parameters are the same. To show an application example of the MPDFRFT, we exploit its multiple-parameter feature and propose the double random phase encoding in the MPDFRFT domain for encrypting digital data. The proposed encoding scheme in the MPDFRFT domain significantly enhances data security","inCitations":["7a9a3c6cbd32d2a13193e35e479fdbfb63fc077d"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660679"],"title":"The Multiple-Parameter Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform and Its Application","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660679","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660679","venue":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings"}

Various studies have suggested inert gases as alternatives. Methods: We studied the cardiopulmonary responses to intravenous infusion of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, argon, helium, and nitrogen in anesthetized swine. The gas was infused into the femoral vein at a rate of 0.1 ml · kg−1· min−1 for 30 min. The changes in end-tidal CO2, mean arterial pressure, hemodynamics, and arterial blood gases were compared to baseline values. Results: No animals died during infusion of the soluble gases (CO2 and N2O). Three of the five pigs infused with nitrogen died suddenly at 20 and 30 min of infusion. The animals in the insoluble gas groups (Ar, He, N2) experienced clinical pulmonary gas embolism and severe acidemia, hypercapnea and tachycardia. Conclusions: Venous gas embolism is poorly tolerated when the gas is relatively insoluble. Insoluble gases should not be used for pneumoperitoneum when there is any risk of venous gas embolism.","inCitations":["f44bdf5f3f384ce01e40731da2b2e70b15868e04","db91fe14eec6111f34b50711f79ff106f3355586","f5c14971f7add1549cd185efd961dce4eed8171f","7a2713091eb90732ce777e3eede1db6ee44cddd8","df617229de6327e894b49a75573d871d93a779bb","16ca3283fdd175e6d8a6734cc78d044065cfb2bc","d8fa2f0e295f4893069082033be6f0a1af8895d7","b008159fffdc8978246c781b52ca2f4e9cd2a0b7","7b987e59fd177f85e20b2e18bd3d993e0876ff75","5ae27b451fd616d5413ac9f79173f4bf6727c2b6","7ce27a7e2e2cc2ec5c03b46a0b71c6b51aef0c81"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cardiopulmonary responses to intravenous infusion of soluble and relatively insoluble gases","doi":"10.1007/s004649900359","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s004649900359","venue":"Surgical Endoscop"}

Entangled optical photons are now widely used for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and applications such as quantum cryptography. Several recent experiments demonstrated entanglement of optical photons with trapped ions, atoms and atomic ensembles, which are then used to connect remote long-term memory nodes in distributed quantum networks. Here we realize quantum entanglement between the polarization of a single optical photon and a solid-state qubit associated with the single electronic spin of a nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond. Our experimental entanglement verification uses the quantum eraser technique, and demonstrates that a high degree of control over interactions between a solid-state qubit and the quantum light field can be achieved. The reported entanglement source can be used in studies of fundamental quantum phenomena and provides a key building block for the solid-state realization of quantum optical networks.","inCitations":["4a374c4824270ae0ccc4e4a46ac01dde0a31aa4c","91aeda196f36b068b733494200aa0d0775de8d61","ecf019195d4f4184638feb8c11ff73d700d3f19f","98f608e4f6e176906baa137f6f048066c4fb9a61","d567107efa452ad3ea58829d807e66ba8e2ec454","1e7e46d75b99e017af0dbbc86858a47eb8bb2eab","2c06f898cfc39ba21b9de2d222a7a2f3b6f81cab","f01fbc18328175eec3293c4030b018a9229a4ffc","aab772282605a88f283140178d0545ddd1d27b2d","10a9fed2fc7a9b1411adcd1315e762038a7b273d","4c166b515870e4a7e9f46d6c7995929a3cf6d2a7","d19c7b4a93e0421961939cc63ea28874f53a3f2f","2129b6890c6534716295f817ff953ef1cafa20bc","9134804befe0eac105b4ee9288682d84d0da14fe","e530caa605d4bf8a24d5f9b69d8724741f8ed3a6","cdb786232cf43e61868b3ea23f9251a571f6164a","26220da4a331fb4ad0cf23dd83b90b305b89486d","207045fd342ab84ef1c6b1a87ba4e296769663f9","2e18dd8c5d8a918ea2035d11dd8063d6e64529ca","dc5ab6a80000bd625959da2bf5f69c264ef4c07f","1c5b56e2d734962cee8d57cd1ed53ef4c558c1b4","9cf862b114761e265d5e8c1e34c66fb74d784b3e","7acaceda84fbeff13d7a1e4f57af0c9b22ca61ff","7d8ebdbe5e58d9fbeb54578bedffe677a3d2d5a9","572d221e5df617a393adceb0f7b23e40989376fb","91d81a50fa70df893446c01071b1aebec17b9084","5582916fbb3443807bfc02b3451662f71e3dcac8","631096f7070bbd6ff75a7ff23cb0149ef7545db1","eb6ba7110c9933dde7762fb3709eab42d6375d7b","f2fc7542cc729782c0d1ac515edd3af8709020f4","1358fb9587f8ad4d76f4ea936877910964ba580d","ed557514cf421abe05dbbd2f8b0c7e77e3c31785","336be2c1a347ea6f57860b094ad8b6712a2572cf","853108739e69d7f65b371734c24ca6e00a78cb59","c9039aa0e38a52ad9998b3ce586151ec2d280cdf","a5079820e4eaac9c542772cadf5171dc77cdd279","2560c176719ed9255c979d9ce51e6cbaf8e5422f","5cdf14e5e8a6d28f7ae088f7116651643b968f2f","0c03ecef536cc5c63e002bfdd80491ed01071aca","b83e94fc723b71ee81204f755198096e547f3a1f","806683a5d809698e6bb9d7424e384cfa561b2458","587eea1aafbecb7f1e6aa9a5224ba96c60c421fa","20cad8e719aa2a786e2cea1dc8e68f87556bc926","125195baa32f44cf1a32e8dde30145f01be333b9","9a22f930a16c65599255bf5c550e98182a0f6755","3a9b5826c0b3cd24220a58f5534f79998b27d98f","a8f5383b6627b7eefb62c6b24ed050b535a5d811","f1c1efd01e644298e14a150ed85ca357b8e25b0b","8128c8fb8476633f2f81cc07c64084f04cce6867","41881fc2522366d901e9f97625ef004b77e95dda","51b256914f7592b8a1a95182358e39de1dc60ff0","24ef42b0a526150020aed5adb5a788b5ad9e3a06","4bd9124f4461caef453a7d4748207e986ed53ad5","9dda790f2dddc1f96ca0ab763927a32505cb3dda","3d7d7dbb888d67ff9b0940a007fb7dca5ccc1947","09481a318f7bd3a8016dd77443b6713185a49ac4","6dc3bd7af6be67f7e82255a4367d4d0bfb89a90a","0247d3741a29b64b223c0578d33b6bb646121e44","f8ea30a18edab2fb00e84e97a5454ea057cb70c5","fcf473d4e516cad0028139bdc0c68bb42a00a247","ae124f76a00c796ec8a9f66966f973e84cc8fde4","cf2de41aa6eca7de6cc307ae75115be4e7a05ca0","413134983e492e2c7dea03601bd752b35cbd6c17","00affbfba96c2c965435dc6eb57560c6949f72ae","b908f5e164c74b73f682e951d4830b076ed28713","60973eb7595d6a1441cb9707ec617c7716bb6de8","71efe34ed3c7f9fa9c7cc6ed23a55179ba47d378","1444e71cb40b812aaf8999ab50f3c1ca0e6b87df","79a87459c5787c0054ce14e0fe6b7fdac7c98914","9a5a372104cf460955cbb7c6e3210d1078aa9f6a","7ffd9a967e1f0874c78f9ce51e9f7b24483d662c","37460dd60e32209a739de9bde2c24acec32fa239","b5674d39133b8aa09bf3471048654a4a8bb35b9a","86a853eeb9d2d2afc837642897bcd467667c27a3","38165bf64149656dfc7d6367d8ceb9b6bfaf1912","c1749107414aee9143cedc9698bc03bd23bdbcb5","b3ef6ad76f9cf3bdf4c18c6599761bcd5c1d80fe","5a662bdcdbf421ff2f443bd1db0254443a19e8ad","5e1da31c3aaeee9463d0a348d5655e6e71179a21","01de49f9be0bb1f3832fca36ac7e9939a341eade","4acf1684a3076e208bd204bb5423ff1c8e9f51fb","9b43d1dad8d14b8ec9f3040fcf2007cdff5911bf","986af175ea5e3689d85105be0b3c7b9a2cbe82a6","8d4fc2724a4e81d4fbd1857fb7a069c6542ad6ba","17b01c22c4c02d6b22a7022dcb566d7235e0f62e","d5576db24d8964a36b252b5dfedd95940a31dcab","00b59370eb669c7c0db7f41d11467347f79bb301","c39c21bdde4fc8bb1655540fab343d43e4711b41","72f0582b37c7ce749bf0fe2567195cc1830df689","0282f5e30639fc0312312d7fdb355b9b823a7c08","4116a1febe5f3583e79cb23dacd5fb61d66924d1","115371967327fe8af6c8d667ba2ca34c2fbe036b","2f6dbeab8ab0f642436dd8e2bc3855a77f148d67"],"pdfUrls":["https://jianggroup.yale.edu/sites/default/files/nature09256.pdf","http://absimage.aps.org/image/MAR11/MWS_MAR11-2010-006386.pdf"],"title":"Quantum entanglement between an optical photon and a solid-state spin qubit","doi":"10.1038/nature09256","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09256","venue":"Nature"}

This had been present for 6 months and was now rapidly increasing in size. Ultrasonography showed an egg-shaped mass with a hypoechoic border and a hyperechoic internal structure with several tiny dense spots showing acoustic shadowing. MRI showed a tumour with well-defined margins and high-signal intensity relative to the neck musculature on T1and T2-weighted images (Fig. 1). The T2-weighted and fat-suppressed inversion recovery images showed higher signal bands radiating from the centre to a higher signal periphery (Fig.2). This hyperintense rim enhanced with contrast agent, but the inhomogeneous centre did not. The mass was completely excised and histological examination showed bands of basaloid cells, calcification, keratinous material and abundant foreign body giant cells consistent with a pilomatrixoma (calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe) (Fig.3). To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the MRI appearance of a pilomatrixoma, a rare benign tumour that arises from the hair matrix. It may be single, or multiple in up to 12%, and appears during the first 2 decades in 60±70% of cases [1]. There is a slight female preponderance, and it is occasionally familial. Most of the tumours seem to develop and disappear without being noticed. One large study estimated that only about 1 in 500 skin tumours is a pilomatrixoma [2], but it seems to be the most common solid cutaneous tumour in patients 20 years of age or younger [3]. The pilomatrixoma we saw was unusually large compared with the cases reported in the literature [4]. Aggressive pilomatrixomas and malignant transformation to pilomatrix carcinoma are rare and occur in up to 9% of benign pilomatrixomas at any age [1, 3]. Malignant tumours may invade locally but metastasise only very rarely [3, 4]. MR imaging may be diagnostic for pilomatrixomas if further reports can confirm the correlation between the high-signal bands in T2-weighted images and the bands formed by basaloid cells evident on histological examination.","inCitations":["f673d0e0292905693e35983a487d4cfa6d2bb6a9","63bce088336b0d49d6fca9ec7b93b280865d2564","ff1905811219b4a180ebd30c3aac2e86f8e40c6c","9c101b04f8998cff9283e358c37bc74089e13569","389df54f3864265c7c578c5d4f0b4a9ce365f7cf","d4766a9be7df2ff717da2074b654eccf0b8475bb","5f02f2de0ffb53987589ecd77dddba5cd7ab3b7d","ca8d76124fea8c205ea9db4f25a8414d39d18cff","3af5cfbf3a8dc628dd85bad1f6bb973d7fb81f20","316dc17f7f686d3d4c4ab386d6cb31f93796deb5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"MR imaging of a pilomatrixoma","doi":"10.1007/s002470050350","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s002470050350","venue":"Pediatric Radiology"}

For the different nutrients, the correlation coefficients vary from 0.45 to 0.60 for adjusted intake. The mean difference of iron intake by the two methods (0.8±2.9 mg) did not differ significantly from zero. The new method correctly classified 38% (iron), 38% (calcium) and 58% (vitamin C) of the subjects to the correct tertile. The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.48 for adjusted vitamin C intake to 0.73 for adjusted calcium intake between two administrations.Conclusion: The newly developed instrument can be used to assess mean group intakes of iron, calcium and vitamin C in women consuming a Western diet. However, since the ranking capability of the new tool is rather weak, further refinement of the tool is required to produce a robust method for assessing iron, calcium and vitamin C intakes of individuals.Sponsorship: This research was supported by the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research/Flemish Division (Fund No G.0152.01).","inCitations":["167aa3a9b329a3bc25ce65965cc6c7e2c4323294","8c30b931f8fb48fc0d17674354f48e70d7eb3522","6c35de934d2062d08fddc4b44731e689f9ce6de5","a388ef2d42f9c48c39166f90facaad0d78058de8","54c50c57536e663c523dc67334780e6cc6ce1e99","7cc1b80e52eb152f6aaa4d1a5e58979718f2ee12","2277fbb4207f71e6f7ce5fc2f3cc62f59312cfa3","bd506d7ea1f85ac0cd5551e83226449e45ec314b","c895481c5affe738930d00a626ae5b7b8e525006","5342d40bc0cba9fe5fa1c1c01b24f44bf661110b","c5ff29143e559adeb0597762f7e8005466895e44","8213300337d00e817e6d7e164159b1852128aaa3","c1467d3946f26bc518d45f970541d377efadc94e","20f3b8b15a1bf50ce618f84b09ae55324aef8b00","0ac1f4ae748a68e6704e98af1a0e193e3347a4b6"],"pdfUrls":["https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/294999/file/6775494.pdf"],"title":"Validity and reproducibility of a computerised tool for assessing the iron, calcium and vitamin C intake of Belgian women","doi":"10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601965","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601965","venue":"European Journal of Clinical Nutrition"}

In attempts to address concerns about acetaminophen, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified gaps in evidence about unintentional misuse among adolescents. Therefore, our objectives were to assess adolescents' (1) health literacy, (2) knowledge about acetaminophen, (3) recent use of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and (4) understanding of medication dosing (instructions for how to use the medicine, i.e., \"acetaminophen skills\"). We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adolescents and young adults (ages 16-23 years) recruited from education settings and health care sites in Monroe County, New York, from 11/08-9/09. Using structured in-person interviews, we assessed acetaminophen knowledge and recent use of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Through role-plays of everyday health scenarios, we assessed participants' abilities to identify acetaminophen in OTC products and answer questions about instructions for acetaminophen use. We measured health literacy with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) for participants >18, and the REALM-Teen for those <18. Confusion about acetaminophen and its use was common. Limited health literacy was an independent risk factor for poor knowledge, misunderstanding, and potential unsafe use of acetaminophen-containing medicines; however, most participants at all health literacy levels erred dangerously in \"unsafe\" understanding of acetaminophen use from label instructions. Individuals with limited health literacy could face disproportionate risk of unsafe use of acetaminophen because of confusion and misunderstanding of label information. Better labeling, public health programs, and educational efforts could facilitate safer use of acetaminophen.","inCitations":["5b6abb139f5e9f5eea74e67d524398f981e6112a","fd12dfa576257f70002abf47128fd94959fdf2b8","1963c545eaf7973706b4f57ef051a8a45cda2bd8","a9b4f658becea0bb0fbb1e1574a766eb3ae8ccb1","83d7f0ef58c65c9b7b83c4f27e7e54cfaaa57c4e","0e8e7b4951fb7214a150708c2889204e50584fce","225b765dfff226f379d5aa92ddf6cd6bbb603ec8","290c42c2719371e3af19e35fcebcb38ef54c43cd","babf82f9f5b7abdbc2772f9d092ecf68d9fa3656","591233a50e6f294a403268db77f69b5ca0f20766","1ecfebe495491b2b03fe5599959ecbf2c5aa51d7","fae78fef0a9ee66a895e802bb4f7b21a7b81b737"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Misunderstanding and potential unintended misuse of acetaminophen among adolescents and young adults.","doi":"10.1080/10810730.2011.604384","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2011.604384","venue":"Journal of health communication"}

This review focuses on the use of cell-based microarrays for assessing the cytotoxicity of drugs, toxins, or chemicals in general. It also summarizes CMA construction principles with respect to the cell types that are used for such microarrays, the readout parameters to assess toxicity, and the various formats that have been established and applied. The review ends with a critical comparison of CMAs and well-established microtiter plate (MTP) approaches.","inCitations":["f2c62fa284fd57be2c22c6c7201c8fb354dbe850"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cell-Based Microarrays for In Vitro Toxicology.","doi":"10.1146/annurev-anchem-071213-020051","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-anchem-071213-020051","venue":"Annual review of analytical chemistry"}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of chemical disinfection and the method of investment on the microhardness of ocular prosthesis acrylic resin.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThirty-two test specimen investments were obtained in two silicones. A segment was cut in each test specimen, and each specimen was fixed in an acrylic disk. The specimens were then polished and submitted to the first microhardness test before immersion in distilled water and incubation for 2 months. During this 2-month period, the specimens were immersed in a water bath at 37 degrees C and were disinfected daily; half were disinfected with neutral soap and the other half were disinfected with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate. After the storage phase and disinfection, a second microhardness test was performed. The surface microhardness values for the acrylic resins were submitted to ANOVA, followed by the Tukey test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe disinfection and the period of storage did not statistically influence the surface microhardness of the acrylic resin, independent of the method of investment of the specimens (Zetalabor or Vipi Sil). The investment of specimens with Zetalabor silicone presented a greater surface hardness, independent of the type of disinfection and the period of storage.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on these results, we suggest that the microhardness of the resin evaluated was not influenced by the method of disinfection or the time of storage used and was affected only by the investment material.","inCitations":["04026174fdd76dc93312c58b957b5126e127f53b","7bae5c5e5a1432051b0fa10c44c13deb9aa48419","2f31cd6f46cffc574374e8f3e67f3716fb8e7433","9b689403e6ca12c8f736dc8812947e91bb1d0e04","6da1d1761ff3b999da465d40a8df530c0fc27bc0","0ad2171515c9e8d8288c8018afe942ffab4be8ac","7d52d6adc35daa31751701543800c111bcbd39cd","dd2b1dc6da050d6d5609797fb23a8c5d0677004a","1825b8feaf2277338a19c411d93e24e402162ddd","83ec0ed243297bcf89aa277fbf6b76f288b14522","488c434c6d5001633d54b294c2d2ce62fe734048","23167129350946cda8f1e6ca03c9f6130f92e5c1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of investment, disinfection, and storage on the microhardness of ocular resins.","doi":"10.1111/j.1532-849X.2008.00372.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-849X.2008.00372.x","venue":"Journal of prosthodontics : official journal of the American College of Prosthodontists"}

This innovation was remarkable for the prospective nature of its development and the public discussions that resolved the ethical dilemma of removing a portion of a liver from a healthy donor for the benefit of another person. Since its inception, this procedure has been uniformly adopted by most pediatric transplant centers, with excellent results. Unfortunately, liver grafts obtained from this procedure did not provide sufficient hepatocyte mass for use in adult recipients. An adult donor procedure was, therefore, developed to provide larger liver grafts, which were derived from the right lobe of the liver. Much of the driving force for adult-to-adult LDLT has been in countries that lack the health-care infrastructure for obtaining deceased donors or have cultural objections to deceased donor transplantation. In developed countries, the initial growth of adult-to-adult LDLT has been tempered by notable donor complications, including death, but it continues to have an important role in providing life-saving liver grafts for recipients who are unable to compete for deceased donor grafts in the current organ-allocation system.","inCitations":["fd95a8afdd924d6ffb861e554d0c9251c2c755ef","18b862e6bba6aced19d7350a2309ef1be47c6578","657d53f3eec6885aa6c06718cfd680a9fb83b81e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Living donor liver transplantation for pediatric and adult recipients","doi":"10.1038/ncpgasthep0437","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncpgasthep0437","venue":"Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology &Hepatology"}

Computer-assisted navigation can be used to assess length change in different fibers within the native ACL and to evaluate how different reconstruction grafts replicate the range of native ligament fiber length change behavior.\n\n\nHYPOTHESIS\nAnterior cruciate ligament reconstruction graft size and configuration (single-vs double-bundle) are deciding factors as to how much of the native ACL fiber length change behavior is replicated.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nControlled laboratory study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe fiber length change behavior of the entire native ACL was assessed by measuring the length change pattern of representative anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundle fibers (1 at the center and 4 at the periphery of each bundle). The tibial and femoral ACL attachment areas in 5 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were digitized, and the length change of each representative fiber was recorded during knee flexion/extension using an image-free, optical navigation system. Subsequently, single-bundle ACL reconstructions of different diameters (6, 9, and 12 mm) positioned at the center of the overall native femoral and tibial attachment sites were modeled to assess how much of the range of ligament fiber length change of the native ligament was captured. This was compared with a double-bundle graft using 6-mm-diameter AM and PL grafts positioned at the centers of the femoral and tibial attachment sites of each separate bundle.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 6-, 9-, and 12-mm single-bundle grafts simulated 32%, 51%, and 66% of the ligament fiber length change behavior of the native ACL, respectively. The length change patterns in these grafts were similar to the central fibers of the native ACL: the PL fibers of the AM bundle and AM fibers of the PL bundle. However, even a 12-mm graft did not represent the most AM and PL native fibers. The 6-mm AM and PL bundle grafts (equivalent in cross-sectional area to a 9-mm single-bundle graft) simulated 71% of the native ACL and better captured the extremes of the range of native ligament fiber length change.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIncreasing single-bundle graft size appears to capture more of the range of native ACL fiber length change. However, for a similar graft cross-sectional area, a 2-bundle graft simulates the length change behavior of the native ligament more precisely and thus may better emulate the synergistic actions of anisometric and isometric fibers of the native ligament in restraining knee laxity throughout the range of flexion.\n\n\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE\nThe range of native ACL fiber length change behavior is better replicated by larger diameter grafts but may be best reproduced by double-bundle reconstruction.","inCitations":["0e6b03fa698644f5489057db4b766379ef2a0241","53332f0a0242b13b7fb8eded6843acf067159350","3c47535f721c516e2364831b89d1801e1cf93ef9","688a302cdf81ac96da56bd9dea927264f935314d","645e9b01dc8a364f02c7a240cb9869428f8b675e","02f23757702513da954da8ff40293952baabc7b1","ad1732bcf4cc35279b238d746a07e81c256ca2b5","e69f477abf2358c9e721de7ca6a8598e498f1f4d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Replication of the range of native anterior cruciate ligament fiber length change behavior achieved by different grafts: measurement using computer-assisted navigation.","doi":"10.1177/0363546509331941","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546509331941","venue":"The American journal of sports medicine"}

However, the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of OA on cell cycle progression has not been completely explored. We employed several lung carcinoma cell lines to investigate the cell cycle-related molecular pathway affected by OA. The data revealed that OA suppressed the proliferation of lung cancer cells in both dose- and time-dependent manners, along with an increase in miR-122 abundance. The suppression of miR-122 abolished the effect of OA on lung cancer cells. CCNG1 and MEF2D, two putative miR-122 targets, were found to be downregulated by OA treatment. Restoring their expression counteracted the effect of OA on lung carcinoma cells. OA was further shown to induce the expression of miR-122-regulating transcriptional factors in lung cancer cells. Collectively, OA induced cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells through miR-122/Cyclin G1/MEF2D pathway. This finding may contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of OA’s anti-tumor activity.","inCitations":["5e068d5d601101f34c7c8f2f83ead93dbc9baabc","99a83ac6c397e50691dde7d74bd8b76b1d917b3f","91707e2c23eedc8faaf927f8bed0b2073a3ffea6","d627336c77dd772f4af1d2d8bf1a76fa0e80eabe","b3bd43b8879bae0152a8d70965f0a4701bad9487","1beb8ee759c1734c51cbc2691cda13de8b2a5656","2ccb609c70c3bd6809ba5bd74c66e3985ef81166","59693637a8440305975cda7bfa2acb534b9ca219","9c3ac57f4ca8b7988ca0c06afe116664bc11ab64","ce6f4e5b004edf440ecb002745654b02c1033495","69b46944ab7bc1f9ada744069413cf1b7d5ff969","a23c2c6505ec257b8754451e812c3bb1aa2e9ef0","82ebea784361133a52a21e04d8af21675400b7a1","a26dff3d8735925ae2bf59d50bf7417aae9dcd5b","cfa07dcdfb6122511fcd7061acb56f1de4f2b653","d911f06fb293eb1a651e3253c7c9b9a666c233ff","6c99a335d5e1f82a3cefe0e12fff7b247bacf08e","1c4f60acc3b740ea09e630371d82d8555eb18f18"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oleanolic acid suppresses the proliferation of lung carcinoma cells by miR-122/Cyclin G1/MEF2D axis","doi":"10.1007/s11010-014-2228-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-014-2228-7","venue":"Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry"}

It contains important cues about the nonstationary content of a signal and yields complementary improvements when it is combined with conventional features derived from short-term analysis. Many prior modulation spectrum approaches are based on uniform modulation frequency decomposition. The drawbacks of these approaches are high dimensionality and a lack of a connection to human perception of modulation. The paper presents multi-scale modulation frequency decomposition and shows an improvement over the standard modulation spectrum in a digital communication signal classification task. Features derived from this representation provide lower classification error rates than those from a constant-bandwidth modulation spectrum, whether used alone or in combination with short-term features.","inCitations":["d4c94b8bbe5b75f033e9e3d2a1282a2e33af18c7","e0a802cba6141af33dd6f810414d129c7e0357af","ac17745c1959b95f6d136205286635ed70484918","6d691d214e1766cefccad931560f81ab6ccf32f6","99f4a9483cdde395e1f6456e914c3c9e772ddc41","4e5a7fa55ccc1ba6e5e548c7c16af21ed0d0a20e"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ee.washington.edu/techsite/papers/documents/UWEETR-2004-0024.pdf","https://www2.ee.washington.edu/techsite/papers/documents/UWEETR-2004-0024.pdf","http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/people/karim/papers/icassp05.pdf","http://melodi.ee.washington.edu/people/karim/papers/icassp05.pdf","http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/ssli/people/karim/papers/icassp05.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1416059","http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/isdl/papers/sukittanon-2005-icassp.pdf"],"title":"Improved modulation spectrum through multi-scale modulation frequency decomposition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1416059","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1416059","venue":"Proceedings.

The Arabidopsis-A. brassicicola host-pathogen pair is being developed as a model genetic system for incompatible plant-fungal interactions, in which the spread of disease is limited by plant defense responses. After confirming that a defense response was induced at the transcriptional level, we identified proteins whose abundance on 2-DE gels increased or decreased in infected leaves. At least 11 protein spots showed reproducible differences in abundance, increasing or decreasing during the progress of the infection. The pathogenesis-related protein PR4, a glycosyl hydrolase, and the antifungal protein osmotin are strongly up-regulated. Two members of the Arabidopsis glutathione S-transferase (GST) family increased in abundance in infected leaves. The spots in which these GST proteins were identified contain additional members of the GST family. Representation of GST family members in several protein spots migrating at similar molecular weight suggests post-translational modifications. The signature of GST regulation may be specific for the type of plant-pathogen interaction. The proteomic view of the defense response to A. brassicicola can be compared with other types of plant-pathogen interactions, and to leaf senescence, identifying unique regulatory patterns.","inCitations":["2c010c86db5331121b814222d7efda3ac03010fa","63d76df92ad14264fefaf2c6b6e4ecee4b1e467b","c45979aba1f6142ad66e4c9fdcf1f12111455ed1","39b88e4aeed3073c8c379b1997af379d8ce84a2a","1df0bdbdedd0e964c6b68ea503408d34fd2a46e0","3621f66cc7000dbe53ca8e410b6df477c57fafb1","984b4d3a3ff1196ff16f95f1062d4ebea5bd5678","264e05bbe5c8845de42aed006119998f49b9f02d","31efecc95aebad869a1c80eebdea90328e6bf839","76f18ea6f0ee3640f5e4c06ebce6a180e6f4cebe","58b2a48566d2c79af3c58718a5a61057ed51f2a9","8c2affffe297da85f7815a5a07ca91443f2529bc","c15743b85ae273cc56ead42d00ae6b0baba5b3ed","eb86fa6afe14936c1bf1813cec9327112a7e81aa","e7d0b89a3b1a7595faa807c2597f7e0efbf7d6c1","f0a14f74663e2be9eb6ec3e701a7327409bd6c2a","bda27f309679d01f30b949923893e90336ad139f","a1da09c06adaf16e74cb202ca4c93f761f8fc22c"],"pdfUrls":["http://gwri-ic.technion.ac.il/pdf/Professors/Shimon_Gepstein/36.pdf"],"title":"Proteomics of the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to infection with Alternaria brassicicola.","doi":"10.1016/j.jprot.2009.10.005","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2009.10.005","venue":"Journal of proteomics"}

A directional microphone (DM) could potentially improve speech recognition in this difficult listening environment. It is well known that DMs in behind-the-ear (BTE) and custom hearing aids can provide a greater signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in comparison to an omnidirectional microphone (OM) to improve speech recognition in noise for persons with hearing impairment. Studies examining the DM in bone anchored auditory osseointegrated implants (Baha), however, have been mixed, with little to no benefit reported for the DM compared to an OM.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThe primary purpose of this study was to determine if there are statistically significant differences in the mean reception threshold for sentences (RTS in dB) in noise between the OM and DM in the Baha® Divino™. The RTS of these two microphone modes was measured utilizing two loudspeaker arrays (speech from 0° and noise from 180° or a diffuse eight-loudspeaker array) and with the better ear open or closed with an earmold impression and noise attenuating earmuff. Subjective benefit was assessed using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) to compare unaided and aided (Divino OM and DM combined) problem scores.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN\nA repeated measures design was utilized, with each subject counterbalanced to each of the eight treatment levels for three independent variables: (1) microphone (OM and DM), (2) loudspeaker array (180° and diffuse), and (3) better ear (open and closed).\n\n\nSTUDY SAMPLE\nSixteen subjects with USNHL currently utilizing the Baha were recruited from Washington University's Center for Advanced Medicine and the surrounding area.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nSubjects were tested at the initial visit if they entered the study wearing the Divino or after at least four weeks of acclimatization to a loaner Divino. The RTS was determined utilizing Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) sentences in the R-Space™ system, and subjective benefit was determined utilizing the APHAB. A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a paired samples t-test were utilized to analyze results of the HINT and APHAB, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults revealed statistically significant differences within microphone (p < 0.001; directional advantage of 3.2 dB), loudspeaker array (p = 0.046; 180° advantage of 1.1 dB), and better ear conditions (p < 0.001; open ear advantage of 4.9 dB). Results from the APHAB revealed statistically and clinically significant benefit for the Divino relative to unaided on the subscales of Ease of Communication (EC) (p = 0.037), Background Noise (BN) (p < 0.001), and Reverberation (RV) (p = 0.005).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Divino's DM provides a statistically significant improvement in speech recognition in noise compared to the OM for subjects with USNHL. Therefore, it is recommended that audiologists consider selecting a Baha with a DM to provide improved speech recognition performance in noisy listening environments.","inCitations":["58a4dd9d265b89fb648ceca31b7f60066f185cca","c7f489720afe87d34a727c7ddbfe72bf8456a50b","5a6e5ebe7eb8d2c60c421cdc97969c5bb5339106","20010b3d247f951e5ccf640ff4e85b81cb5234fc","1822f90657173d76f8a149eacce7b90a46ff3022"],"pdfUrls":["http://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=audio_hapubs","http://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?amp%3Bcontext=audio_hapubs&article=1003"],"title":"Effectiveness of the directional microphone in the Baha® Divino™.","doi":"10.3766/jaaa.21.8.6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3766/jaaa.21.8.6","venue":"Journal of the American Academy of Audiology"}

The RPE of human eyes with geographic atrophy accumulates toxic Alu RNA in response to a deficit in the enzyme DICER1, which in turn leads to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and elaboration of IL-18. Despite these recent insights, it is still unclear how RPE cells die during the course of the disease. In this study, we implicate the involvement of Caspase-8 as a critical mediator of RPE degeneration. Here we show that DICER1 deficiency, Alu RNA accumulation, and IL-18 up-regulation lead to RPE cell death via activation of Caspase-8 through a Fas ligand-dependent mechanism. Coupled with our observation of increased Caspase-8 expression in the RPE of human eyes with geographic atrophy, our findings provide a rationale for targeting this apoptotic pathway in this disease.","inCitations":["58fd70438423185eb5c2f72555dcce33c78556a7","d0874ffbd0977cbadec2c823f2bc40135cb02fc2","e2452a29a22267a43221502ae909c76b9bf10069","3cfe39126b89153c869f363482c36b779dad9794","7382c473f4c90207fee81fa14b2cac5f15dbade7","ecf18d0a7a6e0ad32ab626a3abd5af5b4e32e52b","2769d08ace4d43713c6d303c3149c8188a0f5e2d","a3852392a30f5b57262b73dbad66571a59293994","2b64ed464094de1c4131d3b07d4d7df730bf4798","894e5faf73c94ff1567607a431c906a086135b26","bc7574b96daade702440d36f8eed2656ac16f471","ffa6beaf2fa010af55788528dee5a6188b75626b","0163af53fddd31a9484c45b5f97b379a8a468484","61e9f545427c6ee98317f6f39b28e957b267ef4e","ec3efe3dccc704c7632e1058675a2c61fcfd848c","b9f6538d867990d5b0da607d23630d45e06b392c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pnas.org/content/111/45/16082.full.pdf"],"title":"DICER1/Alu RNA dysmetabolism induces Caspase-8-mediated cell death in age-related macular degeneration.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1403814111","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1403814111","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

Herein we demonstrate, for the first time, the fabrication of an ion selective electrode (ISE) with IPG. A thermal annealing process in a nitrogen ambient environment converts the IPG into a highly conductive electrode (sheet resistance changes from 52.8 ± 7.4 MΩ/□ for unannealed graphene to 172.7 ± 33.3 Ω/□ for graphene annealed at 950 °C). Raman spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis reveals that the printed graphene flakes begin to smooth at an annealing temperature of 500 °C and then become more porous and more electrically conductive when annealed at temperatures of 650 °C and above. The resultant thermally annealed, IPG electrodes are converted into potassium ISEs via functionalization with a poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane and valinomycin ionophore. The developed potassium ISE displays a wide linear sensing range (0.01-100 mM), a low detection limit (7 μM), minimal drift (8.6 × 10-6 V/s), and a negligible interference during electrochemical potassium sensing against the backdrop of interfering ions [i.e., sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca)] and artificial eccrine perspiration. Thus, the IPG ISE shows potential for potassium detection in a wide variety of human fluids including plasma, serum, and sweat.","inCitations":["f4cc8b1fe3a6039f01a196a7eaf14b4dd47f34dc","bfe634b84879d849be9cfc3730b70cb4f2e830ed"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enabling Inkjet Printed Graphene for Ion Selective Electrodes with Postprint Thermal Annealing.","doi":"10.1021/acsami.7b00092","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b00092","venue":"ACS applied materials & interfaces"}

Emerging evidences have indicated its broad participation in regulating various metabolic process via protecting tissues from oxidative stress and improving cellular antioxidant capacity. However, the potential correlation between the oxidative stress and conversion of T4 to T3 is still unclear. In the present study, the effects of T3 and T4 on redox homeostasis in HepG2 cells pre-treated with H2O2 was investigated. It revealed that T3 significantly rescued the apoptotic cell death, consistent with an upregulation of cell antioxidant ability and reduction of ROS accumulation while T4 did not. Afterwards, we examined the enzyme activity and mRNA expression of type 1 5'-deiodianse (DIO1), T3 and rT3 level and found that H2O2 reduced both DIO1 activity and expression in a dose-dependent manner, which consequently declined T3 and rT3 generation. Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) treatment notably restored DIO1 activity, T3 and rT3 level, as well as transcriptional abnormalities of inflammation-associated genes. It suggests that oxidative stress may reduce DIO1 activity by an indirect way like activating cellular inflammatory responses. All these results indicate that the oxidative stress downregulates the conversion of T4 to T3 through DIO1 function in HepG2 cells.","inCitations":["b3218398dbae4fb760bcab43e51e54bb7dda43f5","c66ff94094f3aac9c01ecc02aac1df82362ad8f3","51f684d3f5935e12bf4f4fbe26e09bb7d15367cb","0297f3d6c1ca8dd015264b87dbf46d36b9073350"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Type 1 5'-deiodinase activity is inhibited by oxidative stress and restored by alpha-lipoic acid in HepG2 cells.","doi":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.02.119","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.02.119","venue":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications"}

We tested the efficiency of (1) two distinct laboratory scale biological processes: suspended activated sludge and attached-growth biomass, (2) a combined hydrodynamic cavitation-hydrogen peroxide process and (3) UV treatment. Five pharmaceuticals were chosen including ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and diclofenac, and an active metabolite of the lipid regulating agent clofibric acid. Biological treatment efficiency was evaluated using lab-scale suspended activated sludge and moving bed biofilm flow-through reactors, which were operated under identical conditions in respect to hydraulic retention time, working volume, concentration of added pharmaceuticals and synthetic wastewater composition. The suspended activated sludge process showed poor and inconsistent removal of clofibric acid, carbamazepine and diclofenac, while ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen yielded over 74% removal. Moving bed biofilm reactors were filled with two different types of carriers i.e. Kaldnes K1 and Mutag BioChip™ and resulted in higher removal efficiencies for ibuprofen and diclofenac. Augmentation and consistency in the removal of diclofenac were observed in reactors using Mutag BioChip™ carriers (85%±10%) compared to reactors using Kaldnes carriers and suspended activated sludge (74%±22% and 48%±19%, respectively). To enhance the removal of pharmaceuticals hydrodynamic cavitation with hydrogen peroxide process was evaluated and optimal conditions for removal were established regarding the duration of cavitation, amount of added hydrogen peroxide and initial pressure, all of which influence the efficiency of the process. Optimal parameters resulted in removal efficiencies between 3-70%. Coupling the attached-growth biomass biological treatment, hydrodynamic cavitation/hydrogen peroxide process and UV treatment resulted in removal efficiencies of >90% for clofibric acid and >98% for carbamazepine and diclofenac, while the remaining compounds were reduced to levels below the LOD. For ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and diclofenac the highest contribution to overall removal was attributed to biological treatment, for clofibric acid UV treatment was the most efficient, while for carbamazepine hydrodynamic cavitation/hydrogen peroxide process and UV treatment were equally efficient.","inCitations":["d758cd59a8b4b906bef9956802c2224cbb7bd2ad","61fb23ec4897c9a557ba9ca0e7b85665b76c22a1","0bda72bc2507156cc2212ab82893e11a1591e127","1e222a30f4fb45f11f25a5a33e9065c276227a53","ae67b37ce88acf781ce6afb4c7aca44d1c15260b","f1fc786ae1ebb21703e58ad0525515fb3a95f448","72645fe2afb16cab7a49c8cc375e46231847343f","130d68cf2ae2894ebe4a6664d96ceb31a47e6f93","50240a89ad404af377ad6e11d58757118a3be21b","cc031f5943c75953b9b3174a655e1b5fbde96a4e","43a26a1764ad005605dc2480116d7c56123783ed","6023417b1feef2a17753f2d3e5908024ceb64e03","b240972ce3cbad1f34ccdadae56a0d36c082553f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www2.arnes.si/~mdula/Removal%20of%20pharmaceuticals%20from%20wastewater%20by%20biological%20processes,%20hydrodynamic%20cavitation%20and%20uv%20treatment.pdf"],"title":"Removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater by biological processes, hydrodynamic cavitation and UV treatment.","doi":"10.1016/j.ultsonch.2012.12.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2012.12.003","venue":"Ultrasonics sonochemistry"}

Our approach consists of using the sliding mode theory. First, we construct an integral sliding mode controller to obtain robustness against constant perturbation. Next, to simplify the controller expression we design an adaptive integral sliding surface. To diminish the unwanted chattering phenomenon due to high gain, we design an adaptive sliding controller that adaptively estimates the sliding gain which ensures sliding mode and will decrease as stability is achieved to decrease the chattering amplitude. All the proposed method’s results are illustrated by numerical simulations.","inCitations":["195663d44b7c8a473ad486c655a436e8cc19f10f"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1504/IJMIC.2015.069946"],"title":"Sliding mode control of a hydraulic servo system position using adaptive sliding surface and adaptive gain","doi":"10.1504/IJMIC.2015.069946","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/IJMIC.2015.069946","venue":"IJMIC"}

Methods: Eighty-one patients underwent sclerotherapy and 58 patients, 23 males, 35 females, aged 6–76 years, having a total of 60 cysts, were included in this study; the others were lost to follow-up. The renal cysts were diagnosed by sonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sclerotherapy was performed using 50% acetic acid for 32 cysts in 3 1 patients and 99% ethanol for 28 cysts in 27 patients. Under fluoroscopic guidance, cystic fluid was aspirated as completely as possible. After instillation of a sclerosing agent corresponding to 1 1.7%–25% (4–100 ml) of the aspirated volume, the patient changed position for 20 min and then the agent was removed. Patients were followed up by sonography for a period of 1–49 months. The volume of the renal cyst after sclerotherapy was compared with that of the renal cyst calculated before sclerotherapy. Medical records were reviewed to analyze complications. Results: The mean volume after sclerotherapy of the 17 cysts followed for 3–4 months in the acetic acid group was 5.1% of the initial volume, and for the 14 cysts in the ethanol group it was 10.2%. Complete regression during follow-up was shown in 21 cysts (66%) in the acetic acid group; the mean volume of these cysts before the procedure was 245 ml. The mean volume of the nine (32%) completely regressed cysts in the ethanol group was 184 ml. Mild flank pain, which occurred in three patients in each group, was the only complication and resolved the next day. Conclusion: Acetic acid was an effective and safe sclerosing agent for renal cysts, tending to induce faster and more complete regression than ethanol.","inCitations":["a0960f8bda1be837862f68c838c0a39a07c7f61b","fd12e7697800e99b1871e3777c29dcaa9bc83c15","f5c1da8897248a881fb45d65a6c1da4c7224c953","fdeecc0d533c675127c1a69132fb131ae55253dd","1337a97c4d13cf9320a9e414804c3a27ae9eb31e","8b7f6336b98729ecd39d13e810a599851c9eea56","c97ec2cabb8787c578dfc600a40b7728ad099053","a89c949bdbbe30278fad102bbc951dc64799c197","daaeb3c6155f69331a55f7443cb236f2fd5bb419","cd9dfea2a0cb245c2b6f3982f89faec1f8c875b9","68fb2436fb228fe2d0b1a7f512e7556573c3af8d","44dc68c27c38aa999d944ec54ee93e65ff5311d1","fc2931a888d949ef61c813d85c4c84cdd2217434","1220d5d30617764343f34c79c095681526d65c2d","83ba7e66193908e7c1b7ea8971361fc01eafb812","8878ef4869105dd32f0bcaac4151749bc525eda0","70f5a3077641d2142c00530f94ee1cc899deba66"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Acetic acid as a sclerosing agent for renal cysts: Comparison with ethanol in follow-up results","doi":"10.1007/s002700010039","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s002700010039","venue":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology"}

The mean age at diagnosis was 56 years, and 23 patients (36%) were ≤50 years of age. Clinical evidence of dysproteinemia was present in 62 patients (97%), including multiple myeloma in 38 (59%). M-spike was detected on serum protein electrophoresis in 47 (73%). Serum free light chain ratio was abnormal in all 51 patients tested. Presentation included renal insufficiency, proteinuria, hematuria, and hypertension. Nodular mesangial sclerosis was seen in 39 patients (61%). During a median of 25 months of follow-up (range, 1-140) in 56 patients, 32 (57%) had stable/improved renal function, 2 (4%) had worsening renal function, and 22 (39%) progressed to ESRD. The mean renal and patient survivals were 64 and 90 months, respectively. The disease recurred in three of four patients who received a kidney transplant.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with MIDD generally present at a younger age than those with light chain amyloidosis or light chain cast nephropathy. Serum free light chain ratio is abnormal in all MIDD patients, whereas only three-quarters have abnormal serum protein electrophoresis. The prognosis for MIDD is improving compared with historical controls, likely reflecting earlier detection and improved therapies.","inCitations":["183b04f7967a88f639ccade68fe596fca6ba773d","511784af6b94b911ba6d750e40d21ccd326f1c98","5384f5ddcac60f5037abdfa4b9088f94fa0a1829","3cee42b389b3df08e4761007d8c329aeccf3ee5a","7bb92307cbe0050b758a9c7d1f62bee6b09c9857","3879e85f35545921d767e75d5c588ee91b813323","d43785d018757e7c89991ce5b502b6e272cdfb33","af33193f3017e815d8283b7ca8ddbbc8ab86bb6a","aa04fc4f1a38c6fffb5f729ca55d4338f72d8a04","8bc6e021972050774ab7bf0b424d49b7ac87d191","012845cb65c51ea88fe9d249d07a31e4c0f12117","bf34b3a214de935230434179882cc87a85aef86e","f217581585849ea57cff55fc0d5dd8a7613d957e","56e263ea050dbbe59268d7929ae9f79438b4ecfc","553361b17d5ffa387fb0850250ef17187ab8403c","8483c59c0ebcc05707724fe4aef18bc6f274e4dc","e0827b4b43c69fcff58e3048ce14b9dbd7952f01","31dbf1e6ffb86841fee6fbaf19d30521c7bcc4a5","2b0be1e7d2a00271d1122f6d620d9d12e4d91f71","ebbeedc1a720b8ce42a29d4f0bf9c514367d267b","454e892fed61f6c6327eacd6ebebeaa93e42073f","2da3dc685d723929daaea0cab07c6411f547e8f4","1da679da6e5b47f4ea5ecfd91c514542c5599490","8339c56d37d136743394e7b64a1853ba6e73dfd4","575e7ba9eb87f893d25cf5d3c7306e87338e3d9f","edc2cd1c50fd944a67e928ac1eddeed58ca825d9","f24afb5a5cfab672b88ece918af7f96badcf703a","6f5b35875a94d1d85dc030c3ab6cc7aef44a624d","248eb590223682f3fa6a4b21c31b7b64204c9960","0d31af25ead793ce59cc9598248cdfb7605d7369","0a04509d6df02d1b12deb351f0fe4f710317d808","4dc35a4f0b97eda8f0c4468024d455af9cc7d536","7f728391a04a0da0afe7d1dadc4435e834fda259","14b1313243526930ca515cbc6e5eb34c1fadd7ab","56b8f59c884dede7a6f25c460c310e67d1c0bc5e","e29a04e190c9079fbf195661f73879823e896db7","e8d57f707b282d57871c8edbe759509b5b39c865","a801974dd6c94b48cc1363fe2e297734e4e48525","20a308ba746548f62890f1fac807572f4fcf0c1f","70f3e4a13847544c1af68e2eb36415df38d3b312","57f2d7e71dc5bb43b7fe82c7c2141031b6eb1cd4","29fe6d85237ca106e297273a428be26a1666a9a6","96d65a8771c6c41e69d38c49d481b284c4d7f48e","d9c604b2c2680fa970a4b1e95eb228cac82e18e7","86a80503ab4a7ce388268878b9d7e97c2cf21f8c","f62f8ef8cd98b4466d48b54f0e032231337493ad","1fe4d7b5e43c02a45c6b225495819bd224681bb1"],"pdfUrls":["http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/7/2/231.full.pdf"],"title":"Renal monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease: a report of 64 patients from a single institution.","doi":"10.2215/CJN.08640811","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2215/CJN.08640811","venue":"Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN"}

However, bone cells are not always under physiological stress. In some cases, bone tissue is subjected to an overloaded mechanical environment. For example, a person who is weight training and a stevedore often experience bone pain, inflammation and other bone fatigue damage symptoms. Icariin is the major ingredient of Herba epimedii, which has been widely used for the treatment of bone injury in traditional Chinese medicine, but its mechanism remains unknown. The aim of this study was to probe the effect of icariin on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts exposed to overload and to determine whether the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway is involved in the drug response in osteoblasts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMouse MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to mechanical tensile strain using a four- point bending device to create an overload damage model. An MTT assay was performed to determine the effects of icariin on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. The mRNA and protein levels of ALP, COL-I, OCN, RUNX2 and β-catenin were assessed using RT-PCR and immunoblotting. The protein levels of β-catenin in the MC3T3-E1 cells were also determined using fluorescence microscopy. The mineralization of osteoblasts was assessed using Alizarin Red S staining.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that icariin enhanced the proliferation of osteoblasts exposed to overload and promoted MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation and mineralization. Furthermore, the gene and protein expression levels of β-catenin and RUNX2 all increased with icariin treatment compared with those in the damage group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study suggested that icariin promotes proliferation and differentiation in osteoblasts exposed to overload. The effect of icariin on osteoblastic differentiation acted by activating the RUNX2 promoter and the Wnt/β- catenin pathway.","inCitations":["36d7f909fb5013040c7a1451f9c619c321cf2e4b"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/470896"],"title":"Use of an Osteoblast Overload Damage Model to Probe the Effect of Icariin on the Proliferation, Differentiation and Mineralization of MC3T3-E1 Cells through the Wnt/β-Catenin Signalling Pathway.","doi":"10.1159/000470896","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000470896","venue":"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology"}

Both molecules are trapped as single molecules in the cells of SiC nanomesh at low coverage. At high coverage, CuPc forms a highly ordered single-molecular array with identical symmetry and periodicity as the substrate, whereas pentacene forms a quasi-amorphous layer due to the random mixture of three different adsorption configurations. This difference in adsorption behavior is attributed to differences in molecular geometries. The measured changes of work functions reveal weak charge transfer between the molecules and substrate. Both molecules are preferentially adsorbed on the SiC nanomesh rather than on graphene. The CuPc single-molecular array possesses good long-range order, large area coverage, and a molecular density of over 3.0 x 10(13) molecules/cm(2).","inCitations":["b33ecc364214547996d31b8b1439811a347a9dd9","65645ddf8727b69dc7ea845f35855a456f1e2011","303d95253ffebf104ccc7f7201383341b9c09710"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Template-directed molecular assembly on silicon carbide nanomesh: comparison between CuPc and pentacene.","doi":"10.1021/nn901476m","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/nn901476m","venue":"ACS nano"}

Whether moesin plays any role during the generation of TGF-β-induced Tregs (iTregs) is unknown. Here, we have discovered that moesin is translationally regulated by TGF-β and is also required for optimal TGF-β signaling that promotes efficient development of iTregs. Loss of moesin impaired the development and function of both peripherally derived iTregs and in vitro-induced Tregs. Mechanistically, we identified an interaction between moesin and TGF-β receptor II (TβRII) that allows moesin to control the surface abundance and stability of TβRI and TβRII. We also found that moesin is required for iTreg conversion in the tumor microenvironment, and the deletion of moesin from recipient mice supported the rapid expansion of adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells against melanoma. Our study establishes moesin as an important regulator of the surface abundance and stability of TβRII and identifies moesin's role in facilitating the efficient generation of iTregs. It also provides an advancement to our understanding about the role of the ERM proteins in regulating signal transduction pathways and suggests that modulation of moesin is a potential therapeutic target for Treg-related immune disorders.","inCitations":["60f5b7f1384b71320c88824af21f1e81c5828d2d","df6527b1f5ef74a8f3166522bdeb5e1eec445769"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jci.org/articles/view/89281/version/2/pdf/render","http://www.jci.org/articles/view/89281/version/2/pdf/render","http://www.jci.org/articles/view/89281/version/1/pdf/render"],"title":"Membrane-organizing protein moesin controls Treg differentiation and antitumor immunity via TGF-β signaling.","doi":"10.1172/JCI89281","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI89281","venue":"The Journal of clinical investigation"}

The clinical syndrome associated with above electrocardiogram finding and the history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is referred to as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Various eponyms describing accessory or anomalous conduction pathways in addition to the normal pathway are collectively referred to as preexcitation syndromes. The latter form and associated eponyms are frequently used in literature despite controversy and disagreements over their actual anatomical existence and electrophysiological significance. This communication highlights inherent deficiencies in the knowledge that has existed since the use of such eponyms began. With the advent of curative ablation, initially surgical, and then catheter based, the knowledge gaps have been mostly filled with better delineation of the anatomic and electrophysiological properties of anomalous atrioventricular pathways. It seems reasonable, therefore, to revisit the clinical and electrophysiologic role of preexcitation syndromes in current practice.","inCitations":["9d569d1fa921d9fcb4341d6d19fd0aa6f101bdfd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preexcitation Syndromes.","doi":"10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2015.11.002","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2015.11.002","venue":"Current problems in cardiology"}

Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) allows accurate left-ventricular volumetric measurements in adults.\n\n\nAIMS\nTo validate RT3DE by measuring stroke volume in a normal paediatric population, then to use this new method to calculate regurgitant volume in paediatric patients with MR.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifty-four patients, aged one week to 19 years, (29 without and 25 with MR) had two-dimensional echocardiography coupled with RT3DE left-ventricular volumetric acquisition. Stroke volume was calculated by the Doppler method at the aortic annulus (SV(D)). End-systolic and end-diastolic left-ventricular volumes were measured using the QLab semi-automated method; three-dimensional stroke volume (SV(3D)) was calculated as their difference. In the MR group, regurgitant volume was calculated by the PISA method (RV(PISA)) and as the difference between SV(3D) and SV(D) (RV(3D)). Regurgitant fraction was also evaluated by these methods (RF(PISA) and RF(3D)).\n\n\nRESULTS\nMeasurement feasibility was 88%. In the normal group, SV(3D) (27.9+/-18.1 ml) was highly correlated with SV(D) (30.7+/-19.6 ml; r=0.98; p<0.000). In the MR group, RV(PISA) (15.7+/-14.4 ml) and RV(3D) (11.0+/-10.2 ml) were well correlated (r=0.83; p<0.001). Regurgitant fractions were also well correlated (RF(PISA)=30.4+/-17.0%; RF(3D)=24.3+/-15.9%; r=0.79, p=0.006).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRT3DE is a simple, rapid and reliable method for evaluating stroke volume in children and may, therefore, be useful for evaluating regurgitant volume and fraction in paediatric patients with MR.","inCitations":["845f3956489f727d30063ff79fbe82a454c75bc4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantification of mitral-valve regurgitation in a paediatric population by real-time three-dimensional echocardiography.","doi":"10.1016/j.acvd.2008.09.009","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2008.09.009","venue":"Archives of cardiovascular diseases"}

results.","inCitations":["caa0535de86233d64031e0af772ea266750075ca","21585baae029bef4d418e7f2ea209dbb386af1f8","46b8876ec7828c7576e9af2e745a3b1f5c1b166a","57efe3311b1d5ad3192e2071d5825b17dc9ffaa1","0ea77c7d1c0e75079653eeac56c8c54726a34159","a7fee603669bc5347fe857cdba39b67927e5846b","1955c6801bca5e95a44e70ce14180f00fd3e55b8","83bce92f14c06832b417ed12e42779c2a603209e","19531640d4441d049e5ad9de6ac732a4a20aa1a0","601cc2426e865f4d4d779cf8d6491233dfc06a27","70f8f96c65f864a0dedd7f985d51c90da39f9f02","4771a605bb7a5eec123baa4f430bef1710245335","1d2b3d84d7fbc68ab33cc9b8c750b3b8516c52bf","1c99a5ebf6bd8a23679b608100c033808f06ef41","a27269c5dc2bcd696251a88708cc907dacad7efe","e86779fa8b3dee79fe33b7d94f2ea9bfdb629533","7a81ebb677bad891b1dbae36e5898201d68b5cd5","e430d6bad5b02c0107d0968d629b359251a82275","b92a165739b30426a4ad2fbe3594d21f48081c42","6711f0fa767725dce9c559f2b0a6b614d8666b3d","4c99885ec8d514d4f3cdcda153f594d550277884","6f3b4165e6c5859cdb92096f70b0fd440b23ffbb","54baedad6dc5388d764f2556dffa147326153868","61921256ed7defb75c35b447b815f4350a379d98","de969b2233d5be099efc9455ae04bcc3aabaaa86","1202dc0a62e824857e75274cca0e95d955fa7b27","daf90040ab14b42c6aecd591773b881e23207e51","4d4ca44c0c2f4b4a57a193f02e15d0e42a7d729a","035058bc9e3c1831ea768696a6ede163d3d745f0","18f684b74b970a90793d241d7fe153bf16889256","fc581f2d253549921e070917bc319ff934bd1fca","9b6ca50781bcbcc5613f7b120b8295cd3f6ed933","13d2a89f6d0b444ed7c640bcecc7d9fd4f096290","aecf4bd7a81e5097e8429ee24f928105e9d49a71","9fc287f89283f49f1e60f043554d6d65e5f04e2f","4b01659428cef9d645cb1a1b075eeaa47726decf","8eb9f324daf6d7d87273852a3c820d0e44e3d81c","c30d3ac50a4506ebbb4c40699e7894c2be2d83d3","c5a3fe3c5ceb78d2cfc8ec9a91970c6fb30f5bda","7c44b5062b5c56c38355bb4cf74ba218c4003378","bf5a2c35ca8f69242d61e9a249854bf34c84b567","8f0cdc779d40df11f679ae4eeb142902560f4607","e51d928cbec041d970677d9df1a800b843bacce9","ac2684509711e18970858cb6b57b7b1cc252694c","04e132ecc87f977cd0bd5c739aa55a34675a3cd6","5eda03cb1345ada9505992e49ddd4c76fa3b76f9","87a29ee75573b56eb54de6777aae84bddc7c43df","2974b3174177ad20c5db4ce62fcdac34e2c5c215","3b737b3917d80caf08fee5923c4d99c4bf5890b3","e70e627fadc12538a7da4b5a621f784ab8025aa8","0efed2e18fa580e100faeb1ba95e8dc95b54920f","03b004ac0396b27db78391fbf09a994297f05ef4","1ea5c6e6ae5963394ca1531925d94813433c6c99","69213461e80d8cf3a76437f9ad237589077c90a8","0790f023cb57c63513928ae7a2ac8c99cf3dfdbc","179837906996c2128b5a560559a6efd4e91ee225","a74f39d3014a59567d1fadf8d91309f86f0ca2e1","2432dd04f254a15e8006c8efaf028276eef47295","cdb009a4b46caaa36cb3db1e0716529d39abf3c3","36d33ebf11f4b643f06dacab6567259882183bf1","0293a9b8c50a679b49bf56dd0e17d2fa3c71a205","9412c8e29fe4af128f4dff1d9bbe28e487423b84","73b4739bbc6c8e95e5fc7853a706a527c54a6dc9","2c0378b515987b60a34642507ba1e0bf285dac95","8432dddad4219060280605a0c3819ad05926d670","5eea1f96eab96de4dedb64a9bbc4b044f7967d5e","6901f0475736c9063c26977d98047e4cc07f3d58","fc3b3ce087c4ec58599b57efa78a34ebb51137ed","499e34af559cf3d9298f792406069dfbb5499ad5","36888a1f29fc9a5a27245feff78581ea0bd99f11","8c9593b887f4ddd8c5247e1f7b02b2b5e0e4719a","c8002876e06a3e6e4f2178ebe3a70763cf05bb61","b15b55aff927081f9e622d9393230f22a5e055da","e790889e9263beaeac679678619fb051d7367ddf","4036561a6daf32dbc86daf5260c37055febeaa3d","17a531952b895718d4c559ac386f8709d780f7af","9b99517332596a4d1332c6151613f5d20e4bf3e7","12d38ec302a9aab483b7c7ee0dbeab8192ab7fc8","1a2cf83b0dcf95fe3b21742d7fdceaf2002bff86","ceee5560bcfe1c9234b4d60688bf5f903d60c204","5932b4ca94004126aa3ba218a0c9d4f3c6acf57c","f9b3b3796e7826f2f241a81daa7ac81536ce678a","0c0bc67d9377ed33b6a436a69f48c12f2056592a","4df61f0f09a5bce008ca3638a613f5f95f4fed0e","7bd636afc762952aa8805ba24802ee949d535fc4","6188f657f54b0c88a3b3e73b4dd947cb919d045e","5e05208dc0b17b7b0ee326d1f508c147f7d80a33","ca90b3d44276e546bfdc159bc4984c9605aa3791","47d3efd204f4e32a1b2899a4492c1ac74c0fdcf9","00f637209905e836f6efdfc703595598e3439c8b","66918d4b18d1cfcd73f223b671ddb2f7dd5667e2","2580bb4fa952b110ec199f1b1193d24e95465ba2","87bc6b8c561db31317546ad266dc2943965dc346","5cd24745c48b34d669275f7f92967bf2b9187a1b","b5f5e4a4754e0a863050557cc10dfdf406e04b13","29b1e735baf075551e018d50bb05ef6097ea79b1","01ae3dd3bc78f592b274fefce283ad4b527a28a6","88cc9ddd9987a7abbcb13ed74bfcea5ecb0d1e9c","8a438db59af552c18a66bf7a8d02a5c55fd75246","121f83b3b60f07e4e4e716050704cb64ac51223b","9f71ae624f94e36bc7dfab1935d3ba69609f3b6b","ce11221d3759cef4b2c8792cdf6bb9b1c8434744","d54cbb1e859118e5f36147135c8aa488db1ddcc7","d9089940753e68fd453dd5cd0860628cd25e78d7","ef2e280161533bfdd65fde7e3218bd79805e6833","39301f60b4a8b4e1d6bdf1f47a1161ce95e736ff","0dbeaaf2ec07d0bbdab730df24b642e9a97327bd","a8af4eda858d17bf45af5c6eb09a4b17ed036474","15d51869cf1115e078fa42aeb6f28ecee28fd4c8","306647c55dfeea6add13658e49e1e86464feb777","c1a59f4dfda479dcf42bd44c7ed5ea32d3358a14","692a5f379b7960ef4b0e375b0af1ef9d0a84919b","3a81e934c6c85dc8f39b4d68010e52f479b0ba10","ae9daa0b54860ef7677ee09113cd9e080b5e86b1","2408cc005500d8099fb3e390b96f9d52be7e22dc","1b688a2191c5ddd02d7b2bb828255

Previously, fibulin-4 was shown to bind lysyl oxidase (LOX), an elastin/collagen cross-linking enzyme, in vitro. Consistently, reported defects in humans with EFEMP2 mutations are more severe and broad in range than those due to FBLN5 mutations and encompass both elastin-rich and collagen-rich tissues. However, the underlying disease mechanism in EFEMP2 mutations has not been fully addressed. Here, we show that fibulin-4 is important for the integrity of aortic collagen in addition to elastin. Smooth muscle-specific Efemp2 loss in mouse (termed SMKO) resulted in altered fibrillar collagen localization with larger, poorly organized fibrils. LOX activity was decreased in Efemp2-null cells, and collagen cross-linking was diminished in SMKO aortas; however, elastin cross-linking was unaffected and the level of mature LOX was maintained to that of wild-type aortas. Proteomic screening identified multiple proteins involved in procollagen processing and maturation as potential fibulin-4-binding partners. We showed that fibulin-4 binds procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 1 (Pcolce), which enhances proteolytic cleavage of the procollagen C-terminal propeptide during procollagen processing. Interestingly, however, procollagen cleavage was not affected by the presence or absence of fibulin-4 in vitro. Thus, our data indicate that fibulin-4 serves as a potential scaffolding protein during collagen maturation in the extracellular space. Analysis of collagen in other tissues affected by fibulin-4 loss should further increase our understanding of underlying pathologic mechanisms in patients with EFEMP2 mutations.","inCitations":["9df6059dea6225368850bc6065e4ccc9c250849c","095d13e0e41d5aa7e1141c63da6bc78097a285c2","00a540891a12a40d66dc82596fd81000658514d8","314d5c3bb6000b968ed1ad195bb03035354b154e","9b76f27f46abfde9b447366053068f13eec0cad5","a1270d67d8de50b896c3dc9f84f83ba7ae78abf4","21707c1469cd4a122864952194dbaaf0e6782c55","dbe2d06892e27c101c97232e193794fe9890cb77"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/hmg/24/20/10.1093/hmg/ddv308/2/ddv308.pdf?Expires=1493752204&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=Cz3hiMnbUqSV~kegD1Gmi0sVWd~LYOXpkX1d1U2vb8lDxF2bWXjr26QzZCN4x50~6JBxVlg7uPDupAZawKtZ6tExwV62tqToqAESDQKGwRIWD7VIMS3c4umXS4bi0X78~0pP5iszbctwhCozASSSgGvN4GWSJ4ndDQItb8l8kN4jBK61XQxuVtOzG35U7dco2h-EqVXv9ZV9~Pm~OmslaltBVeJIhDu8Bq8sUu5QoLgFgiJYQpmNXEZ~Gv3rA6iCmcUozIpVNDlvWe4Tr6ioW48Boui45JHUQbmgC9Ge5gvIosyxsh0F~nHGyh56oQ4cUXEqiODxXEedSMfUC507Xg__"],"title":"Loss of fibulin-4 disrupts collagen synthesis and maturation: implications for pathology resulting from EFEMP2 mutations.","doi":"10.1093/hmg/ddv308","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddv308","venue":"Human molecular genetics"}

We hypothesized that an increased metabolic activity of mediastinal lymph nodes would have worse survival even if it is false.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThree hundred and twenty-eight consecutive patients with NSCLC histology were imaged with PET/CT within 90 days of surgery between September 2005 and March 2009. Patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 22), patients with prior history of NSCLC (n = 9) or other malignancies within 5 years (n = 11) were excluded from the study. Patients with negative mediastinoscopy underwent resection. Pathological results were revised according to the seventh tumor-node-metastasis staging system. Kaplan-Meier test was used for survival. Log-rank and Cox analyses were used for comparisons.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 286 patients (262 male; mean age: 58.5 years) were evaluated. There were 22 (6.7%) operative deaths and none of the patients were lost to follow-up. The median follow-up in the remaining 264 patients was 26 months (range, 2-61 months). Tumour size, nodal spread and stage were all strongly associated with survival from NSCLC (P < 0.001). There were 63 true-positive, 65 false-positive (FP), 152 true-negative (TN) and six false-negative findings on mediastinal staging after PET/CT. The maximum standardized uptake value of primary tumour was significantly higher in FP patients than in TN patients (P = 0.012). After excluding pN2-positive patients, TN patients had better survival than FP patients (P = 0.006). Multivariate analysis showed that false-positivity of mediastinal lymph nodes was independently associated with worse survival (hazard ratio = 0.63; P = 0.02). There were 146 patients with pT1-4, pN0 treated with R0 surgical resection. Disease-free survival and overall survival were also significantly better for TN patients in completely resected group (P = 0.009 versus 0.016).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown that false-positivity of mediastinal lymph nodes had yielded worse survival in surgically staged or resected NSCLC patients staged with PET/CT. This result may help to allocate patients with potentially poor prognosis for considered additional therapy.","inCitations":["0906c979e9a71bf1302963dfa8a57cfcc810bc9f","3de13168419b0b29ffe4c5b47106fcd670957402"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/ejcts/41/4/10.1093/ejcts/ezr054/2/ezr054.pdf?Expires=1491354468&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=ZMF0XCaBuR8gWGx8kDBLZyByUt6i9r5xgzKf523eeNCSRvJOaUATROBZ8cNnZfRyCSJMRT8kqtGLr-ICoM7FO9hGI-DfG~VLjdcKW-sl3d00-~nCYxwHIngBc5XMqUDTvDAfpiSuBQh9BJJPFVA03qK1fUCp4h7RCEca7CtnIOOw56hYKYhHz1ptZFqrHupLl~YoyXyLv9v~d1Qp1Q1wR949sixlt9cbcRM5PrMkG0LzzNdGWjHIWSQ8St1RfMBSvv51-712-LZtIfyOTisribltPyJMGMgSIDJronyaxc1nXm1KJ~UOx~ctUdUr6f7LDjjfP7c05xbRystL46QCbg__"],"title":"False-positivity of mediastinal lymph nodes has negative effect on survival in potentially resectable non-small cell lung cancer.","doi":"10.1093/ejcts/ezr054","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezr054","venue":"European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery"}

IFIT proteins do not have any known enzyme activity. Instead, they inhibit virus replication by binding and regulating the functions of cellular and viral proteins and RNAs. Although all IFITs are comprised of multiple copies of the degenerate tetratricopeptide repeats, their distinct tertiary structures enable them to bind different partners and affect host-virus interactions differently. The recent use of Ifit knockout mouse models has revealed novel antiviral functions of these proteins and new insights into the specificities of ISG actions. This article focuses on human and murine IFIT1 and IFIT2 by reviewing their mechanisms of action, their critical roles in protecting mice from viral pathogenesis, and viral strategies to evade IFIT action.","inCitations":["4420e722cec493d72b5f7c4f0abd40c0a9cc9e0e","eab0bbfae6a98189a89291f6d0ac65dc3764a25e","ef78784eba4081375e0e510223f13d66566824e0","305906c09a7d3d47966c7d102bb567022c17cabd","9aba5f730e0f1898fcde8b7ecad23afcd3376f14","2da65c78dcece0585d0b653233abcd230c03056d","4b1ef9a7fe43ecc2a7f1bd6ba49f2ca7600ff862","3a2748a141d3faa2627c521820b9428a96496394","441656e0f7eea90edc2e3cb7e72d362b55e97ce3","ceab18d97f09ef0d9030f0c808f7ab5ab1c7d583","23d7a678a5a9596708f6a7050f2701104f616ec0","038ace91e72ccf2e76919b635f0c1890c02c91a2","2978da0e4bd16344f6227eae16cffc9468223df9","1970f266bbaac9e9e532d79b39fd5f0a4a9d30cd","285527b4756c88bf6a4274fa0e2b95b77e6b9deb","7bf82214e19e9bffdf97c3ec5651d0356d2082da","5667ef49eed766141ec70c4fd2845d9c993d1d33","332eb254154337a13f172ddff2f43a2fc7b277b0","dc7de10933e811946c548cca7b1f3dbe61161d13","111558f5a40e76a686585003a3966a17fc40d82f","aba75c3f74252b3ff61227f6e27a66f1da438f7a","3a08ec0941010a08d7c064d8cf45a28673f754ec","5ffca511cc5511b3defaaa82272cebe3c5c94b65"],"pdfUrls":["http://jvi.asm.org/content/89/5/2462.full.pdf?cited-by=yes&legid=jvi%3B89/5/2462&legid=jvi%3B89/5/2462&related-urls=yes","http://jvi.asm.org/content/89/5/2462.full.pdf"],"title":"Interferon-induced Ifit proteins: their role in viral pathogenesis.","doi":"10.1128/JVI.02744-14","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02744-14","venue":"Journal of virology"}
